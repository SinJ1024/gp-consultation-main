Back Pain,Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite,Gemini,cot,6.77,Success,"The patient presents with back pain that started a week and a half ago, worsening over time. The pain radiates down the right leg, through the thigh and lower leg to the foot, affecting the back and side of the thigh and the side of the lower leg. The patient experiences constant discomfort throughout the day, which interferes with sleep. Pain relief with maximum doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen has been ineffective. The pain started after lifting heavy objects at work, leading to a temporary cessation of work. The patient reports no decrease in leg strength but notes pain limits movement. Sensation is described as ""duller"" on the outside of the right lower leg, with some tingling in the same area. Bowel and bladder function, as well as sensation in the ""riding breeches"" area, are normal.

Physical examination revealed pain upon moving onto the examination couch. No abnormalities were noted in the legs or back upon visual inspection or palpation, and pressing on the vertebrae did not cause significant pain. Lifting the right leg caused pain, while lifting the left leg did not. Sensation was perceived as different and ""duller"" on the right leg compared to the left. Leg strength was tested and found to be equal bilaterally, though the patient experienced pain during the maneuvers. Reflexes were tested and found to be normal.

The doctor's assessment is a herniated disc, likely compressing a nerve, causing radicular pain. The doctor explained that nerve pain is often poorly responsive to NSAIDs and paracetamol.

The plan includes:
1.  **Pain relief:** Prescribing pregabalin, with instructions to start slowly due to potential side effects and a warning about driving while taking it. The goal is to improve sleep and pain.
2.  **Physiotherapy:** Recommended to help decompress the nerve through exercises and improve back flexibility, aiming for the disc to reduce in size and reposition.
3.  **Follow-up:** A telephone appointment in one week to assess pain relief.
4.  **Red flags:** Advised to contact the doctor immediately if symptoms worsen, specifically concerning loss of sensation in the ""riding breeches"" area, inability to control urination/defecation, or significant loss of leg strength.
5.  **Surgery/Imaging:** Deferring CT/MRI scans and surgery for now, as conservative management (pain relief and physiotherapy) is preferred initially. Surgery is considered a later option if conservative treatment fails after a prolonged period (weeks to months).

    *   **Special Tests**: ""lift your right leg all the way up... That hurts."" This is a positive Straight Leg Raise test on the right. The left leg lift was not painful.
    *   **Neurological Exam**:
        *   **Sensation**: ""feels a bit dull on the right side"" when touched on the leg/foot, confirming the subjective report.

Alright, I'm going to analyze this doctor-patient transcript to create a SOAP note. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the patient is presenting with lower back pain that's been going on for about a week and a half. The pain radiates down the right leg, specifically through the back and side to the foot. This suggests a possible nerve involvement, maybe sciatica.

The patient mentions taking paracetamol and ibuprofen without much relief. They've had to stop working and are having trouble sleeping, which indicates the pain is significantly impacting their daily life.

During the physical exam, the doctor didn't find any abnormalities in the legs or back upon visual inspection. However, when lifting the right leg, there was pain. There's some decreased sensation on the right lower leg and a bit of tingling, but strength seems to be maintained. Reflexes are normal, which is a good sign.

The doctor suspects a herniated intervertebral disc causing nerve compression, leading to radiculopathy. They plan to start the patient on pregabalin for nerve pain, along with physical therapy. They also mention monitoring and possibly considering surgery if things don't improve.

So, for the SOAP note, I'll structure it with the subjective symptoms, objective findings, assessment of likely lumbar disc herniation, and the treatment plan including medication and physiotherapy.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient complains of back pain for a week and a half, which is getting worse. The pain radiates down the right leg, specifically the back and side, all the way to the foot. They've tried paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. They're having trouble sleeping and had to stop working. They also mention decreased strength in the leg, some tingling, and a dull sensation on the right lower leg.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor didn't note any vital signs, so I can't include those. The physical exam shows no abnormalities in the legs or back.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient complains of back pain for a week and a half, which is getting worse. The pain radiates down the right leg, specifically the back and side, all the way to the foot. They've tried paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. They're having trouble sleeping and had to stop working. They also mention decreased strength in the leg, some tingling, and a dull sensation on the right lower leg.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor didn't note any vital signs, so I can't include those. The physical exam shows no abnormalities in the legs or back. The patient feels pain when the right leg is lifted. There's decreased sensation on the right lower leg, but strength and reflexes are normal.

For the Assessment, the doctor suspects a herniated intervertebral disc causing nerve compression, leading to radiculopathy.

    *   Actively build in moments of relaxation (e.g., coffee, calling friends, walks, swimming).
    *   Maintain regularity in life (sleep/wake schedule).
    *   Consider consulting occupational health doctor for tips or schedule adjustments.
    *   Balance work and private life.
4.  **Follow-up:**
    *   Check blood test results in 2 working days (call practice or check online portal).
    *   Follow up with mental health nurse.
    *   Return appointment if symptoms worsen or concerns arise.

**Summary Construction:**
- **Subjective:** Condense patient's reported symptoms, duration, triggers, impact on sleep/daily life, and concerns.
- **Objective:** List vital signs and key physical exam findings.
- **Assessment:** State the doctor's primary suspicion (stress) and the plan to rule out somatic causes.
- **Plan:** Bullet points for blood tests, referral, advice, and follow-up.

**Refinement:** Ensure telegraphic style, omit subjects, use fragments, and adhere to constraints. The doctor does not explicitly state a diagnosis like ""stress disorder"" or ""anxiety,"" but rather suspects stress and plans to rule out physical causes. The plan reflects this approach.

Burnout,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,21.68,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient, a newly graduated doctor, presents with physical symptoms attributed to a high-stress job. Key symptoms include body tension, stiff muscles, rapid breathing, and palpitations. These have been present for months but have become a daily occurrence in the last two weeks. Palpitations are described as a fast, regular heartbeat felt in the neck, occurring at rest (not with exertion), and lasting about 30 minutes.

Alright, I'm going to try to break down this transcript and figure out how to create a proper SOAP note. Let's start by understanding what each section requires.

First, the Subjective section should include the patient's symptoms and history without using phrases like ""Patient reports."" So, I need to extract the main complaints the patient has. From the transcript, the patient mentions heart palpitations, rapid breathing, muscle tension, and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms have been ongoing for a few months but have worsened over the last two weeks. The patient also notes that these symptoms are stress-related, tied to a demanding job as a new doctor.

Next, the Objective section should cover the vital signs and physical exam findings. The doctor checked the blood pressure, which was 120/60 mmHg, heart rate at 65 bpm, oxygen saturation at 98%, and respiratory rate at 14 breaths per minute. The physical exam of the heart and lungs was normal, with no murmurs or abnormal sounds.

For the Assessment, the doctor didn't explicitly state a diagnosis but suggested that stress from work is likely causing the symptoms. Since the doctor didn't use definitive language, I should avoid stating a diagnosis. Instead, I can note that stress-related symptoms are likely, based on the context.

The Plan includes the recommended actions. The doctor advised blood tests to rule out conditions like anemia and thyroid issues. They also suggested seeing a mental health nurse and provided lifestyle advice, such as taking breaks, maintaining a routine, and considering occupational health support.

I need to make sure each section is concise and follows the telegraphic style without any introductory phrases. Also, I should avoid including any inferred diagnoses unless the doctor explicitly stated them. Since the doctor mentioned stress as a likely cause, I can include that as a probable assessment.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure each section with the relevant information, ensuring it's comprehensive yet concise.

The patient is a young doctor experiencing stress-related symptoms including heart palpitations, rapid breathing, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms have worsened over the past two weeks. The physical exam revealed normal vitals and no abnormalities. The doctor suspects stress as the likely cause but recommends blood tests to rule out other conditions and suggests consulting a mental health nurse.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is experiencing stress-related symptoms due to a demanding job as a new doctor. They mention muscle tension, heart palpitations, and rapid breathing. These symptoms have increased over the past two weeks. They also have trouble sleeping, worrying about work, and feel the need to persevere despite health concerns. They have a supportive social network but are concerned about possible underlying physical causes like anemia.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor performed a physical exam. Vital signs include BP 120/60, HR 65, oxygen 98%, and respiratory rate 14. The heart and lungs are normal. No abdominal issues were noted.

For the Assessment, the doctor reassured the patient that the physical exam was normal. The symptoms are likely stress-related, possibly due to work overload. The doctor suggested ruling out somatic causes with a blood test for hemoglobin, thyroid, liver, and kidney function.

The Plan includes a blood test and a referral to a mental health nurse. The patient was advised to incorporate relaxation techniques, maintain regular sleep, and consider occupational health services. Follow-up is recommended if symptoms worsen or if the patient has further concerns.

I need to ensure that I'm following the style guidelines: telegraphic, omitting subjects and introductory phrases, using fragments, and being comprehensive yet concise. I should avoid any inferred diagnoses unless explicitly stated, not include any missing values, and keep everything in English.

Let me double-check each section for completeness and adherence to guidelines. Subjective captures all symptoms and history, Objective lists all vitals and exam findings, Assessment is based on the doctor's statements without inferences, and Plan includes all recommended actions. Everything seems to be in order.

Constipation,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,16.38,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of hard, difficult-to-pass stools for approximately three months. Bowel movements are infrequent, occurring every 2-3 days. Associated symptoms include abdominal cramps, a feeling of bloating, and pain on abdominal pressure. The patient denies seeing blood in the stool. There have been no recent changes in diet, although she reports a chronically low appetite. She has a history of being underweight but denies recent weight loss. A family history of ulcerative colitis in her sister is noted. She has tried olive oil, which provided some relief.
2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical examination of the abdomen reveals it to be distended (""a bit rounder""). Auscultation shows normal bowel sounds. Percussion reveals varying tympani and some dampening in the left lower quadrant (LLQ). Palpation is non-tender in the upper abdomen and right lower quadrant (RLQ), but there is sensitivity/tenderness in the LLQ. No vital signs are mentioned.
3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states they are ""thinking more along the lines of irritable bowel syndrome"" and notes the constipation pattern. The doctor also rules out ""alarm bells"" or signs of a more serious condition at this time. Therefore, the assessment is Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. First, a prescription for Psyllium fiber sachets is given to soften the stool. The patient is instructed to take them daily with plenty of water for six weeks. Second, clear return precautions (worsening pain, fever, blood in stool) are provided. Third, a follow-up appointment is scheduled in six weeks to re-evaluate. Finally, a future discussion about a dietitian referral for her underweight status is planned for the next visit.","{

The patient presents with a 3-month history of difficulty passing hard stools, abdominal pain, and bloating. The patient reports not having a bowel movement for 2-3 days, followed by painful and difficult bowel movements. The patient also experiences abdominal cramps and has a history of being underweight. The patient's sister has ulcerative colitis, but the patient does not have similar symptoms.

The doctor performs a physical examination, including listening to bowel sounds, tapping the abdomen, and feeling for tenderness. The examination reveals normal bowel sounds, varying tympani, and sensitivity in the lower left abdomen.

Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the doctor suspects irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and recommends a trial of psyllium fibre to soften the stool.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided doctor-patient transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract the necessary information.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports having trouble passing hard stools for three months, sometimes not going for two to three days. They experience abdominal cramps and bloating. They can eat and drink normally but have a low appetite and are underweight. They've tried olive oil which helps but aren't sure if it's a permanent solution. No blood in stool. Family history includes a sister with ulcerative colitis, but the patient doesn't have other symptoms like those. Urination is normal, and periods are regular.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor didn't mention any vital signs, so I can't include those. On physical exam, the abdomen was examined, and there was sensitivity in the lower left quadrant. No mention of other findings like masses or tenderness elsewhere.

For the Assessment, the doctor considered the symptoms and mentioned that while there are no alarm bells, the pattern suggests Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), possibly constipation-predominant given the hard stools and abdominal pain.

The Plan includes prescribing psyllium fibre sachets to be taken daily with plenty of water for six weeks. The patient is advised to return sooner if symptoms worsen, fever develops, or blood appears in stool. They also plan to discuss a dietitian referral in the next visit.

I need to make sure I follow the style guidelines: telegraphic, omitting subjects and introductory phrases, using fragments, and being concise. Also, I shouldn't infer diagnoses not stated, invent vitals, or include patient identifiers.

So, putting it all together, the Subjective will list symptoms and history, Objective will have exam findings, Assessment will state the likely diagnosis, and Plan will outline the treatment and follow-up.

The patient presents with a 3-month history of constipation, characterized by hard stools and infrequent bowel movements (every 2-3 days).

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each part step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports having trouble passing hard stools for three months, sometimes not going for two or three days. They also mention abdominal cramps, bloating, and being underweight but not losing more weight. They haven't changed their eating habits and can eat normally. They've tried olive oil which helps but are looking for a more permanent solution. No blood in stool. Family history includes a sister with ulcerative colitis, but the patient doesn't think it's the same. Menstrual periods are regular. So I'll note all these points concisely without using ""Patient reports"" or similar phrases.

Next, the Objective section. The doctor examined the abdomen, heard normal bowel sounds, varying tympani, and some dullness in the lower left quadrant. No tenderness except sensitivity in the lower left. No other significant findings. I'll list these findings without any introductory phrases.

For the Assessment, the doctor considers Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) given the symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating. No alarm bells, so no immediate concerns for more serious conditions. I'll state it as ""Likely Irritable Bowel Syndrome"" since the doctor is considering it as a probable diagnosis.

The Plan includes prescribing psyllium fibre sachets daily with plenty of water for six weeks. Follow-up in six weeks, and to seek earlier attention if symptoms worsen, fever develops, or blood appears. Also, a plan to discuss a dietitian next time. I'll list these as bullet points.

Now, I'll review to ensure I didn't include any vital signs not mentioned, didn't miss any medications, and kept everything in English. The draft seems faithful to the transcript, complete, and in the correct language.

Dizziness,Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite,Gemini,cot,4.19,Success,"The patient presents with dizziness that started three days ago upon waking. The dizziness is described as a spinning sensation (vertigo), sometimes accompanied by lightheadedness and mild nausea. It is exacerbated by movement, particularly head movements, and improves when sitting still. The patient denies vomiting, headache, hearing loss, tinnitus, speech difficulties, or limb weakness. She reports occasional heart palpitations when feeling unwell. The patient expresses significant anxiety due to a friend's brain tumor diagnosis and fears a similar condition.

The doctor performs a thorough physical examination. Vital signs (BP 110/70, pulse 62) are normal. Neurological exam, including facial sensation, cranial nerves, motor strength, and coordination (finger-to-nose), is unremarkable. Specific tests for dizziness are performed:
- **Gaze testing:** No nystagmus observed with eyes open.
- **Head Impulse Test (HIT):** Negative bilaterally.
- **Dix-Hallpike maneuver:** Provoked intense vertigo and nausea, with observed nystagmus (though the patient didn't feel it as strongly on the second side). This maneuver was performed sitting to lying with the head extended and turned.

Based on the history and the positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the doctor diagnoses Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The doctor reassures the patient that this condition is not related to a brain tumor and is caused by displaced crystals in the vestibular system. The plan is to perform an Epley maneuver in the clinic today and provide instructions for self-care via thuisarts.nl.

Dizziness,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,15.94,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a primary complaint of dizziness for three days, which started upon waking. The dizziness is characterized as vertigo (room spinning) and is exacerbated by head movements. It is associated with mild nausea but no vomiting, headache, hearing changes, or speech difficulties. The patient denies fainting but reports occasional light-headedness and palpitations during episodes. A recent cold is mentioned. The patient expresses significant anxiety about a potential brain tumor due to a friend's similar experience. Social history is negative for smoking, alcohol, and drug use.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: Vital signs are recorded as BP 110/70 and pulse 62. The neurological examination is largely unremarkable. Cranial nerves are intact. Motor strength and cerebellar function (finger-to-nose, gait, tandem walk) are normal. Specific vestibular testing reveals no nystagmus on smooth pursuit and a negative Head Impulse Test (HIT). However, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is positive, provoking intense vertigo, nausea, and observable nystagmus, confirming a peripheral cause for the vertigo.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly diagnoses the condition based on the classic history and positive Dix-Hallpike test. The diagnosis is stated as ""benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV"". The doctor also explicitly rules out a central cause like a brain tumor, addressing the patient's primary concern.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan involves both immediate treatment and patient education. The doctor performs the Epley maneuver in the office. The patient is educated on the benign nature of BPPV and its cause (displaced otoconia/crystals). The doctor provides reassurance, directly addressing the fear of a brain tumor.

Dizziness,Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking,Gemini,cot,19.91,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient's chief complaint is dizziness, which started 3 days ago upon waking. The character of the dizziness is primarily vertigo (""room is spinning""), aggravated by head movements and relieved by staying still. Associated symptoms include mild nausea and palpitations during episodes. The patient explicitly denies vomiting, headache, hearing issues (loss or tinnitus), speech difficulties, focal weakness, and fainting (syncope). The patient mentions a recent cold but was not bedridden. Social history is negative for tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. The patient's primary concern is a fear of a brain tumor, prompted by a friend's experience.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: Vital signs were recorded: Blood pressure is 110/70 and heart rate is 62 bpm. The physical examination is detailed. The neurological exam is grossly normal, including cranial nerves, motor strength (shoulders, arms, legs), and cerebellar function (finger-to-nose, normal gait, tandem gait). Specific vestibular tests were performed. Smooth pursuit was normal with no nystagmus. The Head Impulse Test (HIT) was negative bilaterally. The key finding is the positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which provoked intense vertigo, nausea, and observable nystagmus, confirming a peripheral cause for the vertigo.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly diagnoses the condition based on the classic history and positive Dix-Hallpike test. The diagnosis stated is ""benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV."" The doctor also directly addresses the patient's concern, ruling out a central cause like a brain tumor.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. The immediate treatment is to perform an Epley maneuver in the office. Patient education is a key component, explaining the cause of BPPV (displaced crystals) and providing reassurance that it is not a brain tumor. For follow-up, the doctor will provide instructions for the patient to perform the Epley maneuver at home, directing them to an online resource (thuisarts.nl).","{

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the conversation step by step.

First, the patient presents with dizziness that started three days ago. It's described as the room spinning, worse with head movement, and accompanied by nausea but no vomiting. They also mention palpitations when dizzy but no fainting. Recent cold symptoms are noted, but no hearing issues, headaches, or neurological deficits.

The doctor's exam shows normal vitals: BP 110/70, pulse 62. Neurological exam is normal, including cranial nerves and muscle strength. The HIT test is negative, and no nystagmus is observed. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver reproduces vertigo, suggesting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

The assessment is BPPV, and the plan includes the Epley maneuver and home exercises.

The patient is a concerned individual presenting with vertigo, characterized by room-spinning dizziness exacerbated by head movements and accompanied by nausea.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports dizziness for three days, worse with head movement, accompanied by nausea but no vomiting, palpitations, or other neurological symptoms. They also mention a recent cold and a friend with a brain tumor causing concern.

Next, the Objective section. The transcript mentions normal blood pressure (110/70 mmHg) and pulse (62 bpm). The neurological exam shows no nystagmus, normal cranial nerve function, and a negative HIT test. The Dix-Hallpike test was positive, indicating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

For the Assessment, the doctor explicitly states BPPV, so that's clear.

The Plan includes the Epley maneuver, patient education, and follow-up. No medications are mentioned, so I won't include any.

I need to ensure I'm using telegraphic style, omitting subjects and introductory phrases. Also, I must avoid any inferred information not in the transcript. Everything seems covered without any missing or added details.

Earache,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,16.81,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of left ear pain and a sensation of fullness (""filled with water"") for the past 2-3 days. The symptoms are gradually worsening. The pain is rated 3-4/10 at baseline, increasing to 6-7/10 after showering. There is associated decreased hearing in the left ear. The patient recently started swimming and cleans her ears with cotton buds three times a week. She denies systemic symptoms like fever or feeling generally unwell and has not taken any painkillers.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The doctor performs a physical examination. Vitals include a temperature of 36.2°C. The right ear exam is normal, with a clear ear canal and a fine eardrum. The left ear examination reveals pain upon pulling the pinna. The external auditory canal is red, swollen, and inflamed, which obscures a clear view of the eardrum.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly diagnoses an inflamed left ear canal (""Your left ear is indeed inflamed. And it's mainly your ear canal that's inflamed.""). This is clinically known as Otitis Externa.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The treatment plan consists of several components:
    *   **Pain Management**: Paracetamol up to 4000mg per day as needed.
    *   **Medication**: Prescription for anti-inflammatory, acidic ear drops to be used three times a day for one week.
    *   **Patient Education**: Instructions to keep the ear dry for one week and to stop cleaning the ear with cotton buds.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract the necessary information.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is Mrs. P, and she's complaining about her left ear feeling like it's filled with water, accompanied by some pain. She mentions that the pain is worse after showering. She's had this for a few days, and it's been gradually getting worse. She also notes some hearing difficulty and is a bit worried about her ear. She rates her pain as around 4 on a scale of 10, but it increases to 6 or 7 after showering. She hasn't taken any painkillers yet and avoids swimming because it worsens the pain. She's been swimming for a few weeks and occasionally uses cotton buds to clean her ears.

Moving on to the Objective section. The doctor didn't find any fever, with a temperature of 36.2°C. Upon examination, the left ear canal is red, inflamed, swollen, and the eardrum isn't clearly visible. The right ear appears normal.

For the Assessment, the doctor diagnosed an inflammation of the left ear canal, likely caused by frequent wetness from swimming and possible irritation from using cotton buds.

The Plan includes prescribing paracetamol up to 4000mg daily for pain, ear drops three times a day for a week, advising against using cotton buds, keeping the ear dry, and a follow-up appointment in a week.

I need to make sure each section is concise, uses telegraphic style, and omits unnecessary words. Also, ensure that only the information explicitly mentioned is included without any inferences.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read through the transcript carefully to extract the necessary information for each section: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is Mrs. P, and she's complaining about her left ear feeling like it's filled with water, accompanied by some pain. She mentions that the pain is worse after showering. She rates her pain as around 4 on a scale of 10, but it increases to 6 or 7 after showering. She also mentions reduced hearing in the left ear and some anxiety about it. She hasn't taken any painkillers yet and hasn't had a fever. She's been swimming more often lately, which might be getting her ear wet more frequently. She also uses cotton buds to clean her ears a few times a week.

Moving on to the Objective section. The doctor checked her temperature, which was 36.2°C, so no fever. Upon examination, the left ear canal is red, inflamed, swollen, and the eardrum isn't clearly visible. The right ear appears normal.

For the Assessment, the doctor diagnosed an inflammation of the left ear canal, likely caused by frequent wetness from swimming and possible irritation from using cotton buds.

In the Plan section, the doctor recommends paracetamol up to 4000mg daily for pain, ear drops three times a day for a week, and advises against further use of cotton buds. She also needs to keep her ear dry and follow up in a week.

Now, I'll structure this into the SOAP note, making sure to follow the style guidelines: telegraphic, omitting subjects and introductory phrases, using fragments, and being concise. I'll also ensure that I don't include any inferred information or miss any details from the transcript.

I should double-check to make sure all the information is accurately captured without adding anything extra. For example, the temperature is explicitly mentioned, so that's included. The medications and dosages are clear, so they're all listed. The follow-up is scheduled, so that's noted.

I think that's all. Now, I'll format it into the required JSON structure.

Eye Infection,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,16.68,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a primary complaint of an irritated right eye that started on a Tuesday morning.

The patient denies vision changes, photophobia (pain with light), and any known triggers like new cosmetics or trauma. Pain is only present when squeezing the eyes shut.

There is some mild crusting in the morning (""it's a bit stuck""). The patient is otherwise well with no systemic symptoms.

Eye Infection,Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking,Gemini,cot,18.19,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of an irritated eye that started on Tuesday morning. Key details extracted are: onset (Tuesday morning), location (started in one eye, now the other is also getting red), quality (feels like a foreign body, ""speck of dust or hair""), and associated symptoms (redness, feeling ""thicker""/swollen, some crusting in the morning). The patient notes pain only when squeezing the eyes shut. Important negatives include no change in vision, no photophobia (pain with light), no known trauma, no new cosmetics, and no contact lens use. The patient is otherwise healthy.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The doctor performs an eye examination. The findings are: visible redness (conjunctival injection) in both eyes. The doctor notes the pupils react normally to light. Examination of the upper and lower eyelids reveals no foreign body or other abnormalities. No purulent discharge is mentioned, which is a key finding.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly diagnoses ""an inflammation of the surface layer of your eye"" and states the cause is ""almost always a virus,"" concluding, ""in your case, I think that's what it is."" This directly translates to a diagnosis of Viral Conjunctivitis.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The doctor's plan is multifaceted. It includes:
    *   **Reassurance**: The condition is self-limiting and will resolve on its own, typically within two weeks.
    *   **Symptomatic Treatment**: Recommends over-the-counter artificial tears for soothing irritation.
    *   **Patient Education**: Advises against rubbing the eye and clarifies that rinsing is unnecessary. Suggests using lukewarm tap water to clean crusted eyelids in the morning.

Alright, I'm going to break down this doctor-patient transcript to create a SOAP note. Let's start with the Subjective section. The patient mentions waking up with an irritated eye on Tuesday morning. She's been experiencing redness, a sensation of something in her eye, and some discomfort, especially when squeezing her eyes. She hasn't had similar issues before and hasn't used any new products. She's been using water and a cotton pad to rinse her eye. She's concerned it might be contagious, especially since she has a daughter.

Moving on to the Objective section. The doctor observed redness in both eyes, more pronounced in one. The pupils reacted normally, and no foreign bodies were found. The doctor didn't mention any specific vital signs, so I won't include those.

For the Assessment, the doctor diagnosed it as a viral conjunctivitis, likely caused by a virus. He noted that the condition is self-limiting and mentioned the possibility of it affecting both eyes.

In the Plan, the doctor recommended using artificial tears for comfort and advised against rubbing the eye. He suggested monitoring for two weeks and returning if symptoms persist or worsen, mentioning possible bacterial infection as a concern if things don't improve.

I need to make sure each section is concise, uses telegraphic style, and avoids any unnecessary words. Also, I should only include what's explicitly stated without adding any inferences.
</think>



The patient presents with a 4-day history of unilateral eye irritation, redness, and foreign body sensation, which has now spread to the other eye. She denies vision changes, pain, or discharge. Exam reveals bilateral conjunctival redness without foreign bodies or vision issues. The doctor attributes this to viral conjunctivitis, likely self-limiting, and advises supportive care with artificial tears and follow-up if worsening or persistent beyond 2 weeks.","{

### Reasoning

The patient presents with a 4-day history of unilateral eye irritation, redness, and foreign body sensation, which has now spread to the other eye. She denies vision changes, pain, or discharge. Exam reveals bilateral conjunctival redness without foreign bodies or vision issues. The doctor attributes this to viral conjunctivitis, likely self-limiting, and advises supportive care with artificial tears and follow-up if worsening or persistent beyond 2 weeks.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports an irritated eye starting Tuesday morning. It's red, feels like something's in it, and the eyelid is thick. She's never had an eye issue before. She's been using a cotton pad with water in the morning. No pain, vision is normal, and no flu symptoms. She has a daughter who's been cuddling with her, but no known exposure to irritants. She's managing well despite her partner being away.

Moving to Objective. The doctor observed redness, especially in one eye, with some redness starting in the other. No foreign bodies were found. Pupils react normally, and the exam of both eyes shows no other issues.

For Assessment, the doctor diagnosed viral conjunctivitis, likely caused by a virus, and mentioned the other eye is starting to show symptoms.

In the Plan, the doctor advised against rubbing, suggested artificial tears for soothing, and mentioned using lukewarm water. Follow-up is recommended in two weeks if symptoms persist or worsen, with a note to seek immediate care if pain, pus, or vision changes occur.

I need to ensure I didn't include any vital signs not mentioned, like temperature or blood pressure, as they weren't discussed. Also, no medications were prescribed, so the Plan focuses on self-care and follow-up. The language is in English, and I avoided any unnecessary phrases.

Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as specified.

Fatigue,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,20.04,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient's chief complaint is fatigue for approximately two months. Key associated symptoms include waking up tired, possibly superficial sleep, increased muscle pain, back pain, and morning stiffness. The patient denies any clear trigger, significant decline in physical performance (still climbs and cycles), shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or specific joint pain. Appetite and weight (72 kg) are stable. Bowel movements are frequent but otherwise normal. Past medical history is significant for controlled hay fever. Family history includes a father with back problems.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical examination findings are documented. Vital signs recorded are blood pressure (110/60) and heart rate (40-60 bpm). The doctor notes the low heart rate is likely due to the patient's athletic condition. The lung exam is clear. The abdominal exam reveals lively peristalsis and is soft and non-tender. The musculoskeletal exam shows some tenderness in the lower paraspinal muscles but is otherwise unremarkable, with a normal neck and shoulder range of motion.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states they do not have a clear diagnosis (""I have absolutely no clue right now""). The primary assessment is fatigue of unknown etiology. The doctor formulates a differential diagnosis to guide the workup, considering anemia, thyroid disorder, and an inflammatory condition (like rheumatoid arthritis, though deemed less likely pending lab results).

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is to investigate the cause of fatigue through laboratory tests. The doctor orders blood work to check for anemia (CBC), thyroid function (TSH), and inflammation markers.

Fatigue,Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking,Gemini,cot,18.01,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient's chief complaint is fatigue for approximately two months. Key details include waking up tired despite sleeping a lot, possibly superficial sleep, and an unclear onset (gradual vs. sudden). The fatigue impacts daily life, causing exhaustion after work and limiting weekend activities to rest, though the patient has not missed work. Associated symptoms include increased muscle pain, back pain, and morning stiffness. Pertinent negatives are significant: physical condition is largely maintained (continues climbing 2-3x/week and cycling without decline), no shortness of breath, no chest pain or palpitations, stable weight (72 kg), normal appetite, and normal bowel/bladder function. A history of hay fever (controlled) and lifelong occasional startling from sleep are noted, but snoring is denied. Family history is notable for father's back problems.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical exam findings are documented. Vitals recorded are blood pressure (110/60) and heart rate (40-60 bpm), which the doctor attributes to the patient's athletic condition. The lung exam is clear. The back exam reveals some tenderness on palpation next to the lower spine, but no pain on pelvic compression and no asymmetry in back or neck muscles. The abdominal exam is normal, with lively peristalsis (bowel sounds), normal percussion, and a supple, non-tender abdomen on palpation.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states they do not have a clear diagnosis (""I have absolutely no clue right now""). The primary problem is fatigue. The doctor is creating a differential diagnosis to investigate with lab work, including anemia, thyroid issues, and inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (though considered less likely). Therefore, the most accurate assessment is ""Fatigue, etiology unclear.""

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this doctor-patient transcript into a SOAP note. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully.

The patient is a 72 kg individual who's been feeling extremely tired for two months. They mention sleeping a lot but waking up tired, which suggests poor sleep quality. They haven't had to call in sick but are less enthusiastic about work and rest a lot on weekends. They still exercise, like climbing and cycling, without a noticeable decline in performance, though they do experience some muscle pain and back pain more than usual.

The patient denies snoring, which might rule out sleep apnea, but mentions startling awake once a week, which isn't new. No respiratory issues, allergies are controlled, and no heart problems. Appetite is good, weight is stable, and bowel movements are normal. They urinate normally but have increased urination frequency, up to four times a day.

On physical exam, blood pressure is 110/60, which is normal. Heart rate is around 40-60, likely due to being athletic. Lungs are clear. Back exam shows some tenderness but no specific joint issues. Abdomen is soft without pain.

The doctor plans blood tests for anemia, thyroid function, and inflammation markers. They'll follow up with the results.

Now, I need to structure this into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections without using full sentences, just telegraphic style. I'll make sure to omit any inferred diagnoses unless the doctor stated them. Since the doctor didn't specify a diagnosis, the assessment will be pending based on blood tests.

For the Subjective, I'll include the fatigue, sleep issues, muscle and back pain, and the absence of other symptoms. Objective will have the vitals and exam findings. Assessment is pending lab results, and the Plan includes the blood tests and follow-up.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports feeling extremely tired for two months. They mention sleeping a lot but waking up tired. They also note that their sleep might be superficial. They haven't called in sick but are less enthusiastic about work. They can still exercise, like climbing two to three times a week and cycling. They experience morning stiffness and muscle pain, including back pain more than usual. They don't have joint pain in hands or feet. No recent illnesses or life events that might have caused this. They don't snore, but their wife notices them startling sometimes. No respiratory issues except controlled hay fever. Appetite is good, weight stable at 72 kg. Bowel movements are normal, urination is normal. They have some concern about rheumatism based on their own research.

Moving to Objective. The doctor checked blood pressure, which was 110/60, and heart rate around 40-60, which is noted as athletic. Lungs are clear. Back exam shows some tenderness near the lower spine. Abdomen is soft, no pain, active bowel sounds. No other abnormalities detected.

For Assessment, the doctor didn't specify a diagnosis but mentioned considering anemia, thyroid issues, and inflammation. They plan to do blood tests for these.

Plan includes blood tests for anemia, thyroid function, and inflammation. The patient will get the test form, and they'll schedule a follow-up phone appointment after results are in.

I need to make sure I don't include any information not in the transcript. The doctor didn't mention specific diagnoses, so the Assessment is about the considerations. No medications were discussed, so the Plan is focused on tests and follow-up.

I should avoid any introductory phrases and keep it telegraphic. Also, ensure all sections are concise and in English.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports feeling extremely tired for two months. They mention sleeping a lot but waking up tired. They also note that their sleep might be superficial. They haven't called in sick but are less enthusiastic about work. They can still exercise, like climbing two to three times a week and cycling. They experience morning stiffness and muscle pain, including back pain more than usual. They don't have joint pain in hands or feet. No recent illnesses or life events that might have caused this. They don't snore, but their wife notices them startling sometimes. No respiratory issues except controlled hay fever. Appetite is good, weight stable at 72 kg. Bowel movements are normal, urination is normal. They have some concern about rheumatism based on their own research.

Moving to Objective. The doctor checked blood pressure, which was 110/60, and heart rate around 40-60, which is noted as athletic. Lungs are clear. Back exam shows some tenderness near the lower spine. Abdomen is soft, no pain, active bowel sounds. No other abnormalities detected.

For Assessment, the doctor didn't specify a diagnosis but mentioned considering anemia, thyroid issues, and inflammation. They plan to do blood tests for these.

Plan includes blood tests for anemia, thyroid function, and inflammation. The patient will get the test form, and they'll schedule a follow-up phone appointment after results are in.

I need to make sure I don't include any information not in the transcript. The doctor didn't mention specific diagnoses, so the Assessment is about the considerations. No medications were discussed, so the Plan is focused on tests and follow-up.

I should avoid any introductory phrases and keep it telegraphic. Also, ensure all sections are concise and in English.

Migraine,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,19.07,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of headaches for approximately two months. The headaches are worsening in frequency, now occurring almost weekly. The pain is described as primarily on the right side but can be diffuse. Associated symptoms include nausea (without vomiting), visual glare, photophobia (preference for a dark room), and phonophobia (worsening pain with conversation). The patient has tried Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, with Ibuprofen noted as effective. A significant family history of migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather) is reported. The patient denies recent stress, smoking, drug use, or significant caffeine intake, and reports only occasional alcohol use.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: Vital signs were recorded: Blood pressure is 120/80 and pulse is 50 bpm. The neurological examination was largely unremarkable. Cranial nerves were intact, strength in arms and legs was good, the finger-to-nose test was normal, and Romberg's test was normal. The only notable finding was that the patient's gait on a straight line walk was ""a bit off"" but ""manageable"".

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states that the symptom cluster is highly suggestive of migraine (""It could very well be a migraine""). The doctor also rules out another differential mentioned by the patient, stating, ""I actually don't think it fits in with cluster headaches."" Therefore, the assessment is ""Likely migraine.""

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. First, medication management involves starting pain relief (Paracetamol, with Ibuprofen as an add-on if needed) at the very onset of symptoms. Second, the patient is instructed to keep a headache diary to monitor for patterns and triggers. Third, patient education is provided by directing the patient to a specific website (thuisarts.nl) for more information on migraines. Finally, a follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks to review the diary and assess progress, with instructions to return sooner if symptoms worsen.","{

}","### Reasoning
1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of headaches for approximately two months. The headaches are worsening in frequency, now occurring almost weekly. The pain is described as primarily on the right side but can be diffuse. Associated symptoms include nausea (without vomiting), visual glare, photophobia (preference for a dark room), and phonophobia (worsening pain with conversation). The patient has tried Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, with Ibuprofen noted as effective. A significant family history of migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather) is reported. The patient denies recent stress, smoking, drug use, or significant caffeine intake, and reports only occasional alcohol use.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: Vital signs were recorded: Blood pressure is 120/80 and pulse is 50 bpm. The neurological examination was largely unremarkable. Cranial nerves were intact, strength in arms and legs was good, the finger-to-nose test was normal, and Romberg's test was normal. The only notable finding was that the patient's gait on a straight line walk was ""a bit off"" but ""manageable"".

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states that the symptom cluster is highly suggestive of migraine (""It could very well be a migraine""). The doctor also rules out another differential mentioned by the patient, stating, ""I actually don't think it fits in with cluster headaches."" Therefore, the assessment is ""Likely migraine.""

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. First, medication management involves starting pain relief (Paracetamol, with Ibuprofen as an add-on if needed) at the very onset of symptoms. Second, the patient is instructed to keep a headache diary to monitor for patterns and triggers. Third, patient education is provided by directing the patient to a specific website (thuisarts.nl) for more information on migraines. Finally, a follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks to review the diary and assess progress, with instructions to return sooner if symptoms worsen.

Alright, let's break down this transcript step by step to create an accurate SOAP note. 

Starting with the Subjective section, the patient reports having headaches for two months, which have been worsening. The pain is primarily on the right side but can generalize. They experience nausea but no vomiting. They also mention sensitivity to light (glare) and prefer resting in a dark room. There's a family history of migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather). The patient has tried paracetamol and ibuprofen with some relief. They don't smoke, drink occasionally, and are physically active. They're a medical student, which might suggest some stress, but they don't report significant stress recently.

Moving to the Objective section, the vital signs show blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg and a pulse of 50 bpm, which is likely due to their regular exercise routine. The neurological exam is normal, including cranial nerves, strength, and coordination tests, though the patient had slight difficulty walking a straight line.

For the Assessment, the doctor suggests it's likely a migraine based on the symptoms: unilateral pain, nausea, light sensitivity, and family history. There's no mention of other diagnoses like cluster headaches, which the doctor seems to rule out.

The Plan includes starting pain relief immediately with paracetamol and ibuprofen as needed. The patient is advised to keep a headache diary to track symptoms and possible triggers. A follow-up appointment in four weeks is scheduled, with the option to come back sooner if things worsen.

I need to ensure that each section is concise, uses telegraphic style, and omits unnecessary words. Also, I must avoid any inferred diagnoses unless the doctor explicitly states them. Since the doctor says it ""could very well be a migraine,"" I'll use ""Likely migraine."" No vital signs are invented, and the plan is clear with specific actions.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is a 20-year-old student who has been experiencing headaches for two months. The headaches are worsening, located mainly on the right side but can be generalized. They report nausea but no vomiting. They also mention sensitivity to light (glare) and prefer lying in a dark room. There's a family history of migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather). The patient has tried paracetamol and ibuprofen with some relief. They don't smoke or use drugs, drink alcohol occasionally, and are physically active.

Moving to the Objective section. The vital signs include blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a pulse of 50 bpm. The neurological exam shows cranial nerves are intact, good fingertip-nose test, normal arm and leg strength, and normal Romberg's test. The patient's gait is slightly off but manageable.

For the Assessment, the doctor suggests it's likely migraines based on the symptoms and family history.

The Plan includes starting paracetamol and ibuprofen as soon as symptoms begin, keeping a headache diary, and scheduling a follow-up in four weeks. The patient was advised to read about migraines on a reliable website and return sooner if symptoms worsen.

I need to ensure that I'm following the style guidelines: telegraphic, omitting subjects and introductory phrases, using fragments, and being concise. Also, I must avoid any inferred diagnoses unless explicitly stated, which in this case, the doctor mentions migraines as a possibility, so it's included.

I should check for any missing or invented information. All vitals and exam findings are from the transcript. No medications dosages were missed. The language is in English as required.

Now, structuring each section accordingly without any markdown, just the JSON.

Skin Lesion,Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite,Gemini,cot,5.99,Success,"The patient presents with a spot on their neck that has been present for two weeks. Initially thought to be a wart, it has scabbed and shed scabs. The patient also recalls an insect bite in the area, leading to swelling and redness. The spot itches but does not hurt. The patient has a history of warts and an abscess in their ear. Family history includes skin issues related to sun exposure on the father's side. The patient is concerned about skin cancer after researching online.

The physical examination reveals a raised, pinkish-red spot, approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, with a redder center. The patient reports intermittent flaking and scab formation, though not currently visible. No lymphadenopathy or other suspicious spots are noted on the neck.

The doctor is unable to definitively diagnose the spot and plans to send a picture to a dermatologist for an e-consultation. Potential diagnoses mentioned by the doctor include pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole. The patient prefers freezing as a treatment option if removal is recommended.

The patient also mentions a separate, new complaint of knee pain for a few months, occurring after running and lingering for days. This is deemed outside the scope of the current visit and requires a separate appointment.

Skin Lesion,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,15.86,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a primary complaint of a ""spot on my neck"" for two weeks. The history of present illness (HPI) includes its onset after shaving or a possible insect bite, initially mistaken for a wart. Key characteristics are swelling, redness, itching, and intermittent scabbing. The patient denies pain. The patient expresses anxiety about skin cancer based on an online search. Relevant family history includes sun-related skin issues on the paternal side (grandfather, uncles), though the specific type is unknown. The patient's other complaint of knee pain is noted but explicitly deferred by the doctor to a future appointment, so it is excluded from this note.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical examination focuses on the skin lesion on the neck. The doctor describes it as a raised, pinkish-red lesion, approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, with a redder center. At the time of the exam, no scab is visible. Palpation of the neck reveals no enlarged lymph nodes (cervical lymphadenopathy). The rest of the neck skin shows only freckles. The doctor uses a magnifying tool with gel (implying dermoscopy) for a closer look. No other vital signs are mentioned.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states uncertainty about the diagnosis (""I wouldn't dare say right away what it is""). A differential diagnosis is provided, including a possible pyogenic granuloma (related to its onset from a wound) or an atypical mole. The assessment must reflect this uncertainty and list the potential diagnoses mentioned.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. The primary action is diagnostic: take a photo of the lesion and send it for a dermatology e-consultation. The doctor educates the patient on potential future treatments pending the dermatologist's advice, which include cryotherapy (freezing), excision, or shave/curettage for histology. The patient expresses a preference for cryotherapy. A clear follow-up plan is established: the doctor will call the patient on Friday with the dermatologist's recommendations.","{

The history of present illness (HPI) includes its onset after shaving or a possible insect bite, initially mistaken for a wart. Key characteristics are swelling, redness, itching, and intermittent scabbing. The patient denies pain. The patient expresses anxiety about skin cancer based on an online search. Relevant family history includes sun-related skin issues on the paternal side (grandfather, uncles), though the specific type is unknown. The patient's other complaint of knee pain is noted but explicitly deferred by the doctor to a future appointment, so it is excluded from this note.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical examination focuses on the skin lesion on the neck. The doctor describes it as a raised, pinkish-red lesion, approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, with a redder center. At the time of the exam, no scab is visible. Palpation of the neck reveals no enlarged lymph nodes (cervical lymphadenopathy). The rest of the neck skin shows only freckles. The doctor uses a magnifying tool with gel (implying dermoscopy) for a closer look. No other vital signs are mentioned.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor explicitly states uncertainty about the diagnosis (""I wouldn't dare say right away what it is""). A differential diagnosis is provided, including a possible pyogenic granuloma (related to its onset from a wound) or an atypical mole. The assessment must reflect this uncertainty and list the potential diagnoses mentioned.

4.  **Plan Analysis**: The plan is multi-faceted. The primary action is diagnostic: take a photo of the lesion and send it for a dermatology e-consultation. The doctor educates the patient on potential future treatments pending the dermatologist's advice, which include cryotherapy (freezing), excision, or shave/curettage for histology. The patient expresses a preference for cryotherapy. A clear follow-up plan is established: the doctor will call the patient on Friday with the dermatologist's recommendations.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the conversation step by step to extract the necessary information.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient came in about a spot on their neck that they've had for two weeks. Initially thought it was a wart, but it doesn't seem to be one. They mentioned it started after shaving, possibly a small wound, and also had an insect bite there. The spot is swollen, redder, and has had scabs falling off periodically. It itches but doesn't hurt. They've had similar spots before, which were warts, but nothing else. Family history includes skin issues, possibly actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma on the father's side. They also mentioned some knee pain, but that's not the main focus here.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor examined the spot, describing it as raised, about half a centimeter, pinkish-red with a redder center. They used a magnifying glass and gel for a better look. No scab was visible at the time, and the patient hadn't scratched it recently. No other similar spots were found, and lymph nodes in the neck were checked but nothing notable except freckles.

For the Assessment, the doctor didn't diagnose anything specific but considered possibilities like pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole. They decided to consult a dermatologist for further evaluation.

The Plan includes taking a picture of the spot and sending it to a dermatologist via e-consultation. The patient was advised to call back on Friday for the dermatologist's advice. Possible treatment options discussed were freezing with liquid nitrogen or surgical removal, with the patient expressing a preference for freezing.

I need to make sure each section is concise, uses telegraphic style, and omits unnecessary words. Also, avoid any inferred diagnoses unless explicitly stated. The knee pain is mentioned but not the focus, so it might be omitted or briefly noted if relevant.

Now, structuring this into the JSON format as specified.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient mentions a spot on their neck that they've had for about two weeks. They initially thought it was a wart but now are unsure. It started after shaving and an insect bite, which caused swelling and redness. The spot itches and has had scabs that fall off. They've used Google Lens to check and are worried about possible skin cancer, especially since there's a family history of skin issues like actinic keratosis. They also mention a knee pain that's been ongoing for a few months, worse after running.

Moving to Objective. The doctor examined the spot, noting it's raised, about half a centimeter, pinkish-red with a redder center. No scab was visible at the time. The doctor considered possibilities like pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole but couldn't diagnose it immediately.

For Assessment, the doctor didn't provide a definitive diagnosis but suggested it could be a pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole. They decided to consult a dermatologist.

In the Plan, the doctor advised sending a photo to a dermatologist via e-consultation. They discussed treatment options like freezing with liquid nitrogen or surgical removal. The patient preferred freezing. They also mentioned the knee pain but didn't have time to address it during this visit, suggesting another appointment.

I need to ensure I follow the style guidelines: telegraphic, omitting subjects and introductory phrases, using fragments, and being concise. Also, I must avoid any inferred diagnoses unless the doctor explicitly stated them. No vital signs or medications were mentioned, so I omit those. Everything should be in English.

Now, I'll structure each section accordingly, making sure to include all relevant points without adding anything extra.

Sore Throat,Gemini-2.5-Pro,Gemini,cot,19.26,Success,"1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of a sore throat for three days.

1.  **Subjective Analysis**: The patient presents with a chief complaint of a sore throat lasting for three days, accompanied by a fever this morning. The patient describes the pain as ""unbearable"" when swallowing (odynophagia). The illness was preceded by a cough last week, which has since resolved. The patient has tried paracetamol and ibuprofen with minimal effect on the throat pain. They deny shortness of breath and a runny nose. The patient expresses concern about a potential abscess, as a friend recently had one. Past history is significant for a sore throat treated with antibiotics during childhood.

2.  **Objective Analysis**: The physical examination reveals a temperature of 38.3°C and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The ear exam shows slight redness in the right ear canal but otherwise normal tympanic membranes. The neck exam reveals small, non-pathological submandibular lymph nodes. The oropharyngeal exam shows a slightly red pharyngeal arch, slightly enlarged tonsils with some slough on both sides (non-kissing), and a midline uvula. The doctor explicitly notes no signs of an abscess. Lung auscultation is clear with vesicular breath sounds.

3.  **Assessment Analysis**: The doctor concludes that the findings (red throat, enlarged tonsils, fever) indicate an infection.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the conversation step by step.

First, the patient mentions having a sore throat for three days and a fever that morning. They also had a cough last week but it's gone now. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen, but the sore throat is still unbearable, especially when swallowing. They don't have other symptoms like shortness of breath or a runny nose. They were concerned about an abscess because a friend had one, but the doctor didn't find any signs of that.

Looking at the physical exam, the doctor checked the ears, which were normal except for some redness in one ear canal. The neck had some small lymph nodes but nothing pathological. The temperature was 38.3°C, indicating a fever. The throat exam showed slightly red pharyngeal arches, enlarged tonsils with some slough, but no abscess. Lungs were clear with normal breath sounds, and oxygen saturation was 98%.

The doctor assessed it as likely viral pharyngitis since no bacterial signs were present. The plan includes continuing paracetamol and ibuprofen, staying hydrated, and using cold remedies for pain. They advised to return if symptoms worsen or if there's difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath.

So, putting this into the SOAP format: Subjective includes the sore throat, fever, and history. Objective includes vitals and exam findings. Assessment is viral pharyngitis. Plan lists the treatments and advice.
</think>



The patient presents with a 3-day history of sore throat and fever, initially accompanied by a cough that has since resolved. They report significant odynophagia and have been using paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. Concerns about an abscess were raised due to a friend's experience, but physical examination did not support this. Vital signs show a fever (38.3°C) and normal oxygen saturation (98%). Throat examination reveals erythematous pharyngeal arches and enlarged tonsils with slough, but no abscess. The clinical impression is viral pharyngitis, and the treatment plan focuses on symptom management with analgesics, hydration, and cold remedies.","{

### Reasoning

The patient presents with a 3-day history of sore throat and fever, initially accompanied by a cough that has since resolved. They report significant odynophagia and have been using paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. Concerns about an abscess were raised due to a friend's experience, but physical examination did not support this. Vital signs show a fever (38.3°C) and normal oxygen saturation (98%). Throat examination reveals erythematous pharyngeal arches and enlarged tonsils with slough, but no abscess. The clinical impression is viral pharyngitis, and the treatment plan focuses on symptom management with analgesics, hydration, and cold remedies.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a sore throat for three days and a fever this morning. They also mentioned a cough last week but it's gone now. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen, but the sore throat is unbearable, especially when swallowing. No shortness of breath, runny nose, or coughing now. A friend had an abscess, making the patient concerned about needing antibiotics.

Moving to Objective. The doctor checked the ears—left was normal, right ear canal a bit red. No lymphadenopathy, just small lymph nodes. Temperature is 38.3°C. Tonsils are slightly enlarged with some slough, but no abscess. Lungs are clear with normal breath sounds, saturation at 98%.

Assessment is viral pharyngitis since the doctor ruled out an abscess and thinks it's viral.

Plan includes continuing paracetamol 1000mg four times daily and ibuprofen 400mg three times daily. Advise cold drinks or popsicles for pain and to stay hydrated. Follow-up if symptoms worsen or if difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath occurs.

I need to make sure I didn't include any extra info not in the transcript, like vital signs or medications. Also, ensure everything is in English and concise.
