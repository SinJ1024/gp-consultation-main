  "Subjective": "Spot on neck for 2 weeks; initially thought wart, now uncertain. Itchy, swollen, red; possibly from insect bite. Scabs form/fall off. History of similar spots (warts). Family history of skin issues (father's side: actinic keratosis/squamous cell carcinoma). Worried about malignancy (melanoma). Used Google Lens, found concerning results. Affects sleep and work. Requests removal; prefers freezing. Also mentions knee pain for months, worse after running.",
  "Objective": "Spot: 0.5 cm, raised, pinkish-red with redder center. No scab currently. No scratching. No similar spots elsewhere. No lymph nodes.",
  "Assessment": "Uncertain etiology; possible pyogenic granuloma or atypical mole. No signs of melanoma.",
  "Plan": [
    "Send photo to dermatologist via e-consultation.",
    "Discuss removal options: freezing, excision, or scraping.",
    "Schedule follow-up call Friday; patient prefers before 10 AM or after 3 PM.",
    "If biopsy needed, will discuss further.",
    "Knee pain: recommend separate appointment for evaluation."
