  "Subjective": "Right eye irritation, started Tuesday morning. Right eye red, visible red veins, feels 'thicker' than left. Constant foreign body sensation (hair/speck of dust) in right eye. Pain when squeezing right eye shut. Left eye started getting red yesterday, now also red. Morning stickiness, uses lukewarm water/cotton pad. Annoying, uncomfortable. No visible foreign body, no new day cream/mascara, no prior injury. No vision changes, no contact lens use, no photophobia. No flu-like symptoms, no fever, cough, or shortness of breath. No pus. Boyfriend away, alone with daughter Isa for 10 days. Request: Check if normal eye infection or something else; needs eye drops/antibiotics? Concern: Contagious for daughter Isa; what if it hurts/gets worse? How long to wait?",
  "Objective": "Right eye: Redness, visible red veins. Left eye: Some redness. No foreign body seen on lower/upper eyelid eversion. Pupils reacting normally to light.",
  "Assessment": "Conjunctivitis, likely viral. No signs of bacterial infection.",

    "Explanation: Viral conjunctivitis, self-limiting, can take up to 2 weeks to resolve.",
    "Advice: Do not rub eyes.",
    "Meds: Artificial tears (OTC) for soothing, as needed.",
    "Advice: Use lukewarm tap water/cotton pad for morning stickiness.",
    "Safety Net: Return if no improvement after 2 weeks.",
    "Safety Net: Return immediately if increased pain, more pus, eyes stuck shut more, or vision changes."
