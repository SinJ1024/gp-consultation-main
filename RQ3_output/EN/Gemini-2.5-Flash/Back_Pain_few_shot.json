  "Subjective": "Back pain x1.5 weeks, worsening. Right-sided, radiating down right leg (posterior thigh, lateral lower leg) to foot. Very uncomfortable, unable to sleep for nights. Constant pain all day. Unable to work (supermarket, heavy lifting), stopped exercising. Meds: Paracetamol (max dose), Ibuprofen (max dose), no relief. Right lower leg (outside) feels duller, some tingling in painful area. Negatives: Leg strength present (pain limits movement, not weakness), normal sensation in 'riding breeches' area, normal urination/defecation. ICE: Concerned, wants pain relief, wants to sleep, asks about CT/MRI/surgery.",
  "Objective": "General: Pain observed getting on couch. Inspection: Legs (L/R) symmetrical, no abnormalities. Back: No unusual findings. Palpation: Back feels normal, no pain on vertebral pressure. Pain more towards gluteal region. Straight Leg Raise (SLR): Right leg lift causes pain. Left leg lift fine. Sensation: Right leg/foot feels duller compared to left. Strength: Bilateral leg strength normal (despite pain during testing). Reflexes: All reflexes good.",
  "Assessment": "Lumbosacral radicular syndrome, susp. Herniated Nucleus Pulposus (HNP). Nerve compression causing pain, decreased sensation/tingling. Ruled out: Cauda equina syndrome (normal perineal sensation, normal bladder/bowel function, normal strength).",
  "Plan": "1. Explanation: Hernia, nerve compression, nerve pain. 2. Meds: Start Pregabalin (slow dose build-up due to side effects). 3. Advice: Driving restriction (1 week after starting/dose change, or if side effects). Physiotherapy recommended for exercises to improve flexibility, aid disc regression. 4. Safety Net: Contact if symptoms worsen (e.g., 'riding breeches' area numbness, inability to urinate/defecate, significant leg weakness/loss of strength). 5. Follow-up: Telephone appointment in 1 week to discuss pain relief progress. 6. No immediate CT/MRI/surgery; conservative treatment first."
