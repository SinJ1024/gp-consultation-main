  "Subjective": "Woke Tuesday with irritated Right eye, thought dust/hair. Rubbed it. Right eye got redder, more red veins, thicker than Left. Feels like constant foreign body sensation. Pain when squeezing eyes shut hard. Uncomfortable. Left eye started redness yesterday. Right > Left initially. Can see properly. No extra light sensitivity. Annoying. Managing well with daughter Isa while boyfriend away. No specific cause identified (no nail, new cream/mascara). No flu-like symptoms. No pus. No vision changes (seeing things). No smoking/alcohol mentioned. Request: Eye check, determine if eye drops/antibiotics needed. Concern: Pain/worsening, contagiousness for daughter.",
  "Objective": "Right eye: Redness, red veins. Pupils react normally to light. No foreign body seen on lower/upper eyelid. Left eye: Redness noted.",
  "Assessment": "Conjunctivitis, likely viral. No signs of bacterial infection or foreign body.",
  "Plan": [
    "Explanation: Viral conjunctivitis, self-limiting, resolves on its own.",
    "Duration: Can take up to 2 weeks to resolve, usually shorter.",
    "Advice: Do not rub eyes.",
    "Symptom relief: Use artificial tears (OTC) for soothing, does not speed healing.",
    "Cleaning: Use lukewarm tap water and cotton pad for stuck eyes in morning.",
    "Safety Net: Return in 2 weeks if no improvement. Return sooner if: increased pain, more pus, eye stuck shut more, or vision changes (seeing things)."
