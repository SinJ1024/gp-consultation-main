  "Subjective": "Neck spot, 2 weeks. Started after shaving (small wound) or insect bite. Initially thought wart, now not. Scabs fall off, new ones form. Swollen, redder, itches. No pain. No similar spots elsewhere. No skin malignancies in family (father's side: sun-related skin problems on head, e.g., actinic keratosis, SCC, BCC, melanoma, but patient unsure of specific diagnosis). Impact: Neck spots uncomfortable, especially if sharp objects near. Concern: Worried about 'serious form of skin cancer' found online, despite not being elderly. Request: Wants to know what can be done; wants it removed; prefers freezing if options available. Left knee pain, few months, after running, lingers days. Not severe. Soccer fine.",
