  "Subjective": "Left eye irritated since Tuesday morning. Initial thought: speck of dust/hair. Left eye red, thicker than other eye, visible red veins. Feels like something constantly in eye. Pain when squeezing eyes shut. Right eye started getting red yesterday. Uncomfortable, annoying. Negatives: No trauma, no new day cream/mascara. No light sensitivity. Vision normal. Not sick with flu. Social: Has daughter (Isa), boyfriend away (10 days alone), working. ICE: Suspects eye infection, wants diagnosis confirmation, asks about eye drops/antibiotics. Worried about worsening, pain, or contagion (for daughter).",
  "Objective": "Ocular: Left eye red with visible red veins, appears thicker. Right eye also red. Pupils react normally to light. No foreign body seen on lower or upper eyelid eversion. Vision normal per patient.",
  "Assessment": "Viral conjunctivitis, bilateral (Left > Right). Ruled out: Foreign body, bacterial infection (no pus, no severe pain, no vision changes).",
  "Plan": "1. Explanation: Viral conjunctivitis, self-limiting, can take up to 2 weeks to resolve. 2. Advice: Do not rub eyes. Use lukewarm tap water/cotton pad for morning stickiness. 3. Meds: Artificial tears (OTC) for soothing (not for faster healing). 4. Safety net: Contact if no improvement after 2 weeks, sudden increase in pain, more pus, eyes stuck shut more, or vision changes. 5. Follow-up: If problems persist after 2 weeks."
