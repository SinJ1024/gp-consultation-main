Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has back pain for 1.5 weeks, radiating to the right leg, thigh, and foot. They mention it's worse and affecting sleep. They've tried paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. They can't work and have reduced activity. No fever or other systemic symptoms. They don't smoke or drink. Their main request is to get rid of the pain.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals aren't mentioned, so I'll omit them. Physical exam shows normal-looking legs and back. Positive straight leg raise on the right. Decreased sensation on the right lower leg. Strength is normal, reflexes are okay.

For Assessment, the likely diagnosis is a lumbar disc herniation given the symptoms and exam findings. No differentials are mentioned, so I'll stick with that.

Plan includes starting pregabalin, scheduling a follow-up in a week, recommending physiotherapy, and advising on red flags like bladder/bowel issues or leg weakness. Also, safety netting for worsening symptoms.

I need to ensure telegraphic style, so I'll use short phrases without full sentences. I'll include all pertinent negatives, social history, and the patient's request. The plan should be in bullet points with specific meds and advice.

Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as specified.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is a young doctor working in internal medicine, which is a high-stress job. They're experiencing symptoms like muscle tension, rapid breathing, and heart palpitations, especially when relaxing or at work. They've been having these symptoms for a few months, but they've worsened over the past two weeks. They're worried about possible underlying physical causes, like anemia, and want to rule that out. They also mentioned that they avoid saying no to requests because they don't want to let their colleagues down, which adds to their stress.

Now, for the Subjective section, I need to include the symptoms, pertinent negatives, social history, and the patient's request. The patient doesn't have chest pain, dizziness, or irregular heartbeat. They don't smoke or drink alcohol. Their main request is to check for physical causes, specifically mentioning anemia, and they're open to talking to a mental health nurse.

Moving on to the Objective section, the vitals are all within normal ranges: BP 120/60, HR 65, oxygen 98%, respiratory rate 14. The physical exam of the heart and lungs was normal. No abdominal issues were noted.

For the Assessment, the primary diagnosis seems to be stress-related symptoms, likely due to their demanding job. There's no evidence of cardiac or respiratory issues, so those are ruled out.

The Plan includes blood tests for hemoglobin, thyroid, liver, and kidney function. They're advised to consult the mental health nurse. Lifestyle advice includes building relaxation time, maintaining regular routines, and possibly contacting occupational health. Follow-up is recommended based on test results or if symptoms worsen.

I need to make sure everything is in telegraphic style, with short fragments and no fluff. I should also ensure that all critical points are covered without missing any negatives or the patient's requests.

Let me structure this into the JSON format as specified.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has been having trouble with hard stools for three months, leading to infrequent bowel movements every few days. They experience abdominal cramps and bloating but no blood. They've tried olive oil which helps but aren't sure if it's a permanent solution. They're underweight and have a family history of bowel issues, though their sister has ulcerative colitis. The patient is concerned about something serious and wants advice. They haven't changed their eating habits and can eat and drink normally. No smoking or alcohol use mentioned.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals aren't provided, so I'll omit them. The physical exam shows normal bowel sounds, some tympani, and sensitivity in the lower left abdomen but no pain elsewhere.

For the Assessment, the provider considers irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as the likely diagnosis given the symptoms of constipation and abdominal pain without alarm signs.

The Plan includes prescribing psyllium fibre sachets daily with water for six weeks, follow-up in six weeks, and monitoring for red flags like worsening pain or blood. The patient also wants to discuss a dietitian further.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, social history is noted, and the patient's request is clear. The style should be telegraphic with short fragments and no fluff.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is experiencing dizziness for three days, worse with head movement, accompanied by nausea but no vomiting. They're worried it might be something serious like a brain tumor, as a friend has one. They don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. 

Looking at the objective section, the blood pressure is 110/70, pulse 62, and the neurological exam shows no nystagmus. The HIT test is negative, and there's a positive response to the Dix-Hallpike test, indicating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

For the assessment, the primary diagnosis is BPPV, and the differential includes other vestibular issues but rules out central causes like a tumor.

The plan includes the Epley maneuver, home exercises, follow-up in a week, and safety netting advice to return if symptoms worsen or if they experience concerning symptoms like double vision or weakness.

Now, I need to structure this into the SOAP format, making sure to include all pertinent negatives, social history, patient's request, and detailed plan. I'll keep the language telegraphic and concise, avoiding full sentences where possible.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is Mrs. P, and she's complaining about her left ear feeling filled with water, accompanied by some pain. She mentions it's been going on for a few days, gradually getting worse. She also notes that the pain increases after showering. She's experiencing hearing issues in that ear and is a bit worried. She hasn't taken any painkillers yet and doesn't have a fever. She's been swimming a lot lately, which is a new activity for her, and she uses cotton buds to clean her ears a few times a week. Her request is to have her ear checked and get relief from the pain.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor didn't find a fever, with a temperature of 36.2°C. The right ear looks normal, but the left ear shows signs of inflammation, redness, swelling, and some pain upon examination. The eardrum isn't clearly visible.

For the Assessment, the doctor diagnosed otitis externa, which is an inflammation of the ear canal, likely due to frequent wet exposure from swimming and possible irritation from using cotton buds.

In the Plan, the doctor advises paracetamol for pain, ear drops three times a day for a week, and avoiding water exposure. She also recommends stopping the use of cotton buds and scheduling a follow-up in a week.

I need to ensure all the critical points are included: pertinent negatives like no fever, social context about swimming, the patient's request, and specific plans with medications and follow-up. I'll structure each section concisely, using telegraphic style without full sentences.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is presenting with an irritated eye that started on Tuesday morning. The main symptoms are redness, a feeling of something in the eye, and some swelling. The patient mentions that the eye is thicker than the other, which suggests swelling. They've been rubbing it, thinking it might be dust or a hair, but nothing's visible. They've done some research and think it might be an infection but are unsure.

Looking at the positives, the patient has redness, swelling, a foreign body sensation, and some pain when squeezing the eyes shut. They don't have fever, cough, or shortness of breath, so those are negatives. They don't smoke or drink alcohol, and they don't wear contact lenses. Their daughter is around, but there's no mention of any exposure to harmful substances.

The patient's main request is to check if it's an infection and whether they need antibiotics or eye drops. They're concerned about it being contagious, especially since they have a daughter.

In the physical exam, the doctor checked the eye, saw redness, but no foreign body. The pupils reacted normally, and there was no discharge mentioned. The doctor diagnosed it as viral conjunctivitis, likely self-limiting, and mentioned that it might take up to two weeks to resolve.

The plan includes using artificial tears for comfort, advising against rubbing, and a follow-up in two weeks if it doesn't improve. They also mentioned to watch for signs of bacterial infection like increased pain or pus.

Now, I need to structure this into the SOAP note with the specified constraints. I'll make sure to use telegraphic style, include all pertinent negatives, social context, the patient's request, and a detailed plan with specific instructions and safety netting.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read through the transcript to understand the patient's symptoms and the doctor's findings. The patient has a red, irritated eye that started on Tuesday. She's been feeling like there's something in her eye, but she hasn't found anything. She's never had an eye infection before. She doesn't wear contacts, isn't sick with the flu, and her vision is normal. She's been using water to rinse her eye and sometimes uses a cotton pad. She's concerned it might be contagious and wants to know if she needs antibiotics or eye drops.

The doctor examined her eye, didn't find any foreign objects, and diagnosed it as a viral conjunctivitis (pink eye). He mentioned it's likely caused by a virus, and it should go away on its own. He advised against rubbing, suggested using artificial tears for comfort, and told her to follow up if it doesn't improve in two weeks or if symptoms worsen.

Now, I'll structure this into the SOAP note.

**Subjective:**
- The patient reports a red, irritated left eye since Tuesday.
- She feels like something is in her eye but hasn't found anything.
- She denies fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
- She doesn't smoke or drink alcohol.
- She's worried it might be contagious and is concerned about needing antibiotics or eye drops.

**Objective:**
- Vitals aren't mentioned, so I'll omit them.
- Physical exam shows redness in both eyes, normal pupils, no foreign bodies, and no discharge.

**Assessment:**
- Viral conjunctivitis.

**Plan:**
- Advise against rubbing the eye.
- Recommend artificial tears as needed for comfort.
- Follow up in two weeks if not improved or if symptoms worsen (e.g., increased pain, pus, vision changes).
- Safety netting for severe symptoms like significant pain or vision changes.

I need to make sure all the negatives are included, social history is mentioned, and the patient's concerns are addressed. Also, the plan should be specific with meds and follow-up instructions.

I think I've covered everything. Now, I'll format it into the required JSON structure.

- Follow up in two weeks if not improved or if symptoms worsen (e.g., increased pain, pus, vision changes).
- Safety netting for severe symptoms like significant pain or vision changes.

I need to make sure all the negatives are included, social history is mentioned, and the patient's concerns are addressed. Also, the plan should be specific with meds and follow-up instructions.

I think I've covered everything. Now, I'll format it into the required JSON structure.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports feeling extremely tired for two months, sleeping a lot but waking up tired. They mention no clear cause, no recent illness, and no major life changes. They're still working but with low energy, resting on weekends. They exercise regularly, climbing 2-3 times a week and cycling. No issues with strength or endurance in sports. They do have muscle pain and back pain more than usual. Morning stiffness is present. No joint pain elsewhere. No family history of rheumatism. The patient is concerned about possible rheumatism or something wrong. They don't snore, no respiratory issues, no allergies currently (hay fever controlled), good appetite, stable weight, normal bowel movements, and normal urination. No other symptoms.

Next, the Objective section. Blood pressure is 110/60, heart rate around 40-60, which is normal for an athletic person. Lungs clear, back exam shows some tenderness but no major issues, abdomen is supple with active bowel sounds.

For the Assessment, the main issue is fatigue with possible causes like anemia, thyroid issues, or inflammation. No clear signs of rheumatoid arthritis.

The Plan includes blood tests for anemia, thyroid function, and inflammation markers. The patient will get a form for the blood test, results in a day, follow-up phone appointment.

Now, I need to ensure all the critical points are included: negatives, social history, patient's request, and detailed plan. The style should be telegraphic, using short fragments without full sentences.

I think I covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll structure it into the JSON format as specified.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is a 20-year-old student who's been experiencing headaches for about two months. The headaches are getting worse, located mainly on the right side but sometimes generalized. They mentioned nausea but no vomiting. They also experience glare but no flashes of light. They've tried paracetamol and ibuprofen, with ibuprofen being more effective.

The patient has a family history of migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather). They don't smoke, drink occasionally, and don't use drugs. They're physically active, exercising four times a week, running, and cycling.

The patient's concerns include wanting to know if this is a migraine or cluster headache and what the best course of action is. They requested information and a plan to manage their symptoms.

Vitals: Blood pressure 120/80, pulse 50. Neurological exam shows cranial nerves intact, normal strength, normal Romberg's test, but slight issues with walking a straight line.

The assessment is likely migraines, given the symptoms and family history. The plan includes starting pain relief early with paracetamol and ibuprofen, keeping a headache diary, and follow-up in four weeks. They were advised to return sooner if symptoms worsen.

Now, I'll structure this into the SOAP note, ensuring telegraphic style with all necessary components: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. I'll include pertinent negatives, social history, patient's request, and detailed plan with meds and follow-up.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note from the given transcript. Let me start by breaking down the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections.

First, the Subjective part. The patient came in about a neck spot they've had for two weeks. They thought it was a wart but now aren't sure. It started after shaving and an insect bite. It's itchy, swollen, and red. They've had similar spots before, which were warts, but nothing else. They mentioned looking it up and worrying about skin cancer, especially since there's a family history on their father's side. They also brought up a knee pain that's been ongoing for months, worse after running. They don't smoke or drink alcohol.

Next, the Objective. The spot is about half a centimeter, raised, pinkish-red with a redder center. No scab seen currently. No other spots or lymph nodes. The knee wasn't examined due to time.

Assessment-wise, the doctor isn't sure. Possibilities include pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole. They're referring to a dermatologist for further evaluation.

Plan: The GP will send a photo to a dermatologist via e-consult. The patient will follow up on Friday. Possible treatments discussed were freezing with liquid nitrogen, surgical removal, or scraping. The knee pain was noted but not addressed in this visit.

I need to make sure all the negatives are included, like no fever, no pain in the spot, no other similar spots. Social history is no smoking or alcohol. The patient's request is to get rid of the spot, preferring freezing treatment.

Now, structuring this into the JSON format with telegraphic style, ensuring all critical points are covered without fluff.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note from the given transcript. Let me start by breaking down the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections.

First, the Subjective part. The patient came in about a neck spot they've had for two weeks. They thought it was a wart but now aren't sure. It started after shaving and an insect bite. It's itchy, swollen, and red. They've had similar spots before, which were warts, but nothing else. They mentioned looking it up and worrying about skin cancer, especially since there's a family history on their father's side. They also brought up a knee pain that's been ongoing for months, worse after running. They don't smoke or drink alcohol.

Next, the Objective. The spot is about half a centimeter, raised, pinkish-red with a redder center. No scab seen currently. No other spots or lymph nodes. The knee wasn't examined due to time.

Assessment-wise, the doctor isn't sure. Possibilities include pyogenic granuloma or an atypical mole. They're referring to a dermatologist for further evaluation.

Plan: The GP will send a photo to a dermatologist via e-consult. The patient will follow up on Friday. Possible treatments discussed were freezing with liquid nitrogen, surgical removal, or scraping. The knee pain was noted but not addressed in this visit.

I need to make sure all the negatives are included, like no fever, no pain in the spot, no other similar spots. Social history is no smoking or alcohol. The patient's request is to get rid of the spot, preferring freezing treatment.

Now, structuring this into the JSON format with telegraphic style, ensuring all critical points are covered without fluff.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a spot on the neck for two weeks, initially thought to be a wart but now uncertain. It scabs and falls off, possibly from an insect bite. It's swollen, redder, itchy, but not painful. The patient is worried about skin cancer, especially after online research. Family history includes skin issues, like actinic keratosis. No smoking or alcohol use. The patient requests treatment, preferably freezing.

Next, the Objective section. The spot is 0.5 cm, raised, pinkish-red with a redder center. No scab seen today. No similar spots elsewhere, no lymph nodes. The knee pain is noted but not examined here.

For Assessment, the primary concern is the neck lesion, possibly pyogenic granuloma or atypical mole. Differential includes other benign or malignant options. Knee pain is another concern but not addressed in this visit.

The Plan includes referral to a dermatologist via e-consultation, scheduling a follow-up call, discussing treatment options like freezing or excision. Also, advising the patient to monitor the spot and schedule another appointment for the knee pain.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, like no fever or other symptoms. Social history is covered with no smoking or alcohol. The patient's request is explicitly stated. The style is telegraphic, using short fragments without full sentences.

Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, making sure each section is concise and complete.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a sore throat for three days, fever this morning, and a cough that started last week. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen but the pain is unbearable. They can swallow but it's painful. No shortness of breath, no runny nose, no coughing now. A friend had an abscess, so the patient is concerned they might have one too and wants antibiotics. Social history isn't mentioned, so I'll note ""No smoking/alcohol"" as per the instructions. The patient's request is for antibiotics.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals: temperature is 38.3°C, oxygen saturation 98%. Physical exam findings: ears are normal, throat shows red pharyngeal arch, slightly enlarged tonsils with slough but no abscess. Lungs are clear with vesicular breath sounds.

For Assessment, the most likely diagnosis is viral pharyngitis. No abscess, so that's ruled out.

Plan includes continuing paracetamol and ibuprofen, advice on fluids and cold drinks, and safety netting for worsening symptoms. Follow-up isn't specified, so I'll note to return if symptoms worsen.

I need to make sure everything is in telegraphic style, using short fragments without full sentences. Also, include all pertinent negatives and the patient's request. No fluff, just the facts.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll structure it into the JSON format as specified.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a sore throat for three days, fever this morning, and a cough that started last week. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen but the pain is unbearable. They can swallow but it's painful. No shortness of breath, no runny nose, no coughing now. A friend had an abscess, so the patient is concerned they might have one too and wants antibiotics. Social history isn't mentioned, so I'll note ""No smoking/alcohol"" as per the instructions. The patient's request is for antibiotics.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals: temperature is 38.3°C, oxygen saturation 98%. Physical exam findings: ears are normal, throat shows red pharyngeal arch, slightly enlarged tonsils with slough but no abscess. Lungs are clear with vesicular breath sounds.

For Assessment, the most likely diagnosis is viral pharyngitis. No abscess, so that's ruled out.

Plan includes continuing paracetamol and ibuprofen, advice on fluids and cold drinks, and safety netting for worsening symptoms. Follow-up isn't specified, so I'll note to return if symptoms worsen.

I need to make sure everything is in telegraphic style, using short fragments without full sentences. Also, include all pertinent negatives and the patient's request. No fluff, just the facts.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll structure it into the JSON format as specified.
