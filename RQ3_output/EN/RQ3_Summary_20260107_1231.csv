Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a 1.5-week history of lower back pain radiating down the right leg, specifically the posterior thigh and lateral lower leg to the foot. They mention it's worse on the right side. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen without relief. They're having trouble sleeping and have stopped working and exercising. They report decreased sensation and tingling on the right lower leg. No issues with bowel/bladder function. They requested pain relief and are concerned about needing surgery.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals aren't mentioned, so I'll omit them. On physical exam, the right leg has decreased sensation and positive straight leg raise test. Strength is normal, reflexes are intact, and no muscle atrophy.

For the Assessment, the diagnosis is lumbosacral radicular syndrome likely due to a lumbar disc herniation. There's no evidence of cauda equina syndrome.

The Plan includes starting pregabalin, recommending physiotherapy, advising activity modification, scheduling a follow-up in a week, and monitoring for red flags like bowel/bladder changes or leg weakness.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, like no fever or bowel issues. Social history isn't mentioned, so I'll note no smoking or alcohol. The patient's request is for pain relief and concerns about surgery. The plan should be concise with specific meds and follow-up details.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is a young doctor experiencing stress-related symptoms due to a demanding job. Symptoms include muscle tension, heart palpitations, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath. These occur mainly during rest, like when taking a bath or lying in bed. The patient also has trouble falling asleep because of work-related worries, leading to about 6 hours of sleep. They've been experiencing these symptoms for a few months, worsening over the past two weeks. The patient is concerned about possible underlying physical causes, like anemia, and wants to discuss this with a professional. Social history includes living with housemates who are also doctors, providing a support system. The patient doesn't smoke or drink alcohol.

Moving to the Objective section. Vital signs are normal: BP 120/60, HR 65, SpO2 98%, RR 14. Physical exam shows normal heart and lung sounds, no murmurs. Blood tests are planned for Hgb, thyroid, liver, and kidney function.

For the Assessment, the primary diagnosis is stress-related symptoms, likely due to occupational stress. Ruled out are cardiac issues, anemia, and thyroid problems pending blood test results.

The Plan includes blood tests, referral to a mental health nurse, lifestyle advice like relaxation techniques, and follow-up if symptoms worsen. Safety netting advice about rest and seeking occupational health support is also provided.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, like no chest pain, dizziness, or irregular heartbeat. Social history is covered, and the patient's request is explicitly stated. The style should be telegraphic with short fragments, no full sentences, and laterality specified where needed. Since the symptoms are generalized, laterality isn't required here.

Now, I'll structure this into the JSON format as specified.

- **POSITIVE symptoms**: Hard stools for 3 months, bowel movements every 2-3 days, difficult passage of stool, abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, stomach more swollen than usual, pain on abdominal pressure (subjective), chronic poor appetite, chronic underweight status. Family history of sister with ulcerative colitis. Tried olive oil which helped soften stool. On exam: abdomen bloated, varying tympany, LLQ dampening on percussion, LLQ tenderness on palpation.
- **NEGATIVE symptoms**: No recent change in eating/drinking habits, no recent weight loss (stable underweight), no blood in stool, no change in urination. Regular menses. No other family members with similar bowel issues. On exam: normal bowel sounds, no tenderness in epigastrium or RLQ, no renal lodge tenderness.
- **Request/Concerns**: Patient asks ""Should I be concerned about this?"" and ""What can I do about it?"". Wants to make stool softer. Also interested in future help with being underweight.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has been having trouble with hard stools for three months, sometimes not going for two to three days. They experience abdominal cramps and bloating. They can eat and drink normally but have a low appetite and are underweight. They haven't lost more weight recently. They've tried olive oil which helps but aren't sure if it's a permanent solution. They're concerned about whether this is serious and want advice. They also mentioned their sister has ulcerative colitis but don't think they have the same issue. No blood in stool, no changes in urination, and regular periods. They're underweight and have a family history of being underweight.

For the Objective, the exam shows normal bowel sounds, some tympany on abdominal percussion, and sensitivity in the lower left abdomen. No tenderness elsewhere.

Assessment is likely Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) with constipation, as alarm symptoms like weight loss and blood are absent. No signs of more serious conditions like inflammatory bowel disease.

Plan includes prescribing psyllium fiber sachets daily with water for six weeks, follow-up in six weeks, advice on high-fiber diet, and monitoring for red flags like worsening pain, fever, or blood in stool. Also, plan to discuss dietitian referral next time.

Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, making sure to follow the telegraphic style and include all necessary details without fluff.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has been having trouble with hard stools for three months, sometimes not going for two to three days. They experience abdominal cramps and bloating. They can eat and drink normally but have a low appetite and are underweight. They haven't lost more weight recently. They've tried olive oil for stool softening. No blood in stool. They're concerned about the seriousness of their condition and want advice. They're interested in seeing a dietitian. Their sister has ulcerative colitis, but they don't think they have the same issue. No smoking or alcohol use.

Next, the Objective section. Vital signs aren't mentioned, so I'll omit those. On physical exam, normal bowel sounds, abdomen soft but sensitive in the lower left quadrant. No tenderness elsewhere.

For Assessment, considering the symptoms and exam, IBS is likely, specifically constipation-predominant. No alarm signs like weight loss or blood, so less likely to be something more serious like inflammatory bowel disease.

The Plan includes prescribing psyllium fiber, advising increased fluids and possible dietary changes. Safety netting for worsening pain, fever, or blood. Follow-up in six weeks and discuss dietitian referral then.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, social history is brief, and the patient's request is clear. Also, keep the language telegraphic without full sentences.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by going through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is experiencing dizziness for three days, which started when they woke up. The dizziness is described as the room spinning, which suggests vertigo. It's present both when eyes are open and closed, though the patient hasn't specifically tried it. The symptoms are worse in the morning upon waking and with head movements, but improve when sitting still. They also mention some nausea but no vomiting. There's no headache, hearing issues, or neurological deficits like speech problems or limb weakness. The patient did have a recent cold but hasn't been bedridden. They don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Their friend has a brain tumor, which is causing concern.

On physical exam, blood pressure is 110/70 and pulse is 62, both normal. Neurological exam shows no facial asymmetry, normal cranial nerves, and no nystagmus. The HIT test is negative, but the Dix-Hallpike maneuver was positive on the right, inducing vertigo and nystagmus. The left side was less intense. The assessment points to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), likely from otolith dysfunction, and rules out central causes like a brain tumor.

The plan includes the Epley maneuver, home exercises, activity modification, and follow-up in a week if symptoms persist. Safety netting advises seeking help for worsening symptoms or new issues.

Now, I'll structure this into the SOAP note, making sure to follow the telegraphic style with all required elements: positives, negatives, social history, patient's request, and a detailed plan with specific actions and safety netting.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient reports dizziness for three days, worse with head movement. They also mention nausea but no vomiting, palpitations, and a fear of a brain tumor. They don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Their daily life is impacted as they can't function normally.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals are BP 110/70 and pulse 62. Physical exam shows normal cranial nerves, no nystagmus, negative HIT test bilaterally, and positive Dix-Hallpike on the right.

For Assessment, the diagnosis is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Ruled out are central causes like brain tumor and other inner ear issues.

Plan includes Epley maneuver, home exercises, activity modification, follow-up, and safety netting for worsening symptoms.

I need to ensure all negatives are included, social history is present, and the patient's request is clear. Also, keep the style telegraphic without full sentences.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient is Mrs. P, and she's experiencing left ear discomfort. She describes it as feeling filled with water, accompanied by pain that worsens after showering. She also mentions hearing loss in the left ear. She's been having these symptoms for a few days, which have been gradually worsening. She hasn't taken any painkillers yet, but the pain is manageable, rating it around 4/10, increasing to 6-7/10 after showering. Her daily activities are affected, specifically swimming, which she's been doing for a few weeks. She uses cotton buds to clean her ears about three times a week. She's worried about her ear and wants the pain to go away. She denies fever and other systemic symptoms.

Moving to the Objective section. The doctor didn't find any fever, with a temperature of 36.2°C. The right ear appears normal, but the left ear shows an inflamed, red, swollen ear canal with limited visibility of the eardrum.

For the Assessment, the likely diagnosis is otitis externa, given the inflammation of the ear canal, likely due to frequent moisture exposure from swimming and cotton bud use. There's no indication of more severe conditions like cauda equina.

The Plan includes prescribing paracetamol for pain, ear drops three times daily for a week, advising against using cotton buds, keeping the ear dry, and a follow-up in a week.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I'll read through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information. The patient is Mrs. P, and she's complaining about her left ear feeling filled with water, along with some pain. She mentions that the pain is worse after showering. She's been experiencing this for a few days, and it's been gradually getting worse. She also notes that her hearing is affected in that ear and she's a bit worried about it.

She doesn't have a fever, as she mentioned, and hasn't taken her temperature. She hasn't used any painkillers because the pain is manageable, rating it around 4 out of 10 normally and up to 6 or 7 after showering. She's had to cut back on swimming because it worsens the pain. She uses cotton buds to clean her ears a few times a week but not very often.

The doctor's examination shows that the left ear canal is red, inflamed, swollen, and thick, likely due to frequent wetness and cotton bud use. The plan includes painkillers like paracetamol, ear drops, avoiding cotton buds, keeping the ear dry, and a follow-up in a week.

Now, I need to structure this into a SOAP note. Let's break it down into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan.

For the Subjective section, I'll include her symptoms, the duration, the impact on her activities like swimming, her concerns, and her request for help. I'll also note that she doesn't have a fever and isn't using painkillers.

In the Objective section, I'll list the vital signs, specifically the temperature, and the physical exam findings, focusing on the left ear's condition.

The Assessment should include the diagnosis, which seems to be otitis externa, and any ruled-out conditions if mentioned, though in this case, it's not explicitly stated, so I might just focus on the confirmed diagnosis.

The Plan will outline the medications, lifestyle advice, and follow-up instructions given by the doctor.

I need to ensure that I'm using telegraphic style, so I'll keep sentences short and fragmented. I'll also make sure to include all pertinent negatives, like no fever, and her social history, such as no smoking or alcohol mentioned. Her request was to have her ear checked because of the pain and hearing issue.

I should also specify laterality, so it's clear that the left ear is affected. I'll note the severity of the pain and how it's worse after showering.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft each section, making sure to follow the constraints and include all necessary details without any fluff.

For the Subjective section, I'll include her symptoms, the duration, the impact on her activities like swimming, her concerns, and her request for help. I'll also note that she doesn't have a fever and isn't using painkillers.

In the Objective section, I'll list the vital signs, specifically the temperature, and the physical exam findings, focusing on the left ear's condition.

The Assessment should include the diagnosis, which seems to be otitis externa, and any ruled-out conditions if mentioned, though in this case, it's not explicitly stated, so I might just focus on the confirmed diagnosis.

The Plan will outline the medications, lifestyle advice, and follow-up instructions given by the doctor.

I need to ensure that I'm using telegraphic style, so I'll keep sentences short and fragmented. I'll also make sure to include all pertinent negatives, like no fever, and her social history, such as no smoking or alcohol mentioned. Her request was to have her ear checked because of the pain and hearing issue.

I should also specify laterality, so it's clear that the left ear is affected. I'll note the severity of the pain and how it's worse after showering.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft each section, making sure to follow the constraints and include all necessary details without any fluff.

Eye Infection,Llama-Reasoning-70B,DeepSeek-Llama,cot,19.43,Success,"<think>
Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is presenting with an eye issue. They woke up on Tuesday morning with an irritated right eye. They mentioned it's red, thicker than the other eye, and feels like there's something in it, causing discomfort. They've been researching online and think it might be an infection but want to make sure it's not something else.

Looking at the positives, the patient has redness, especially in the right eye, which is worse than the left. They feel like there's a foreign body, and the eye is uncomfortable, though not painful. They can see normally, and there's no photophobia. The left eye is starting to show some redness too, indicating it might be spreading.

For negatives, the patient denies fever, cough, or shortness of breath. They don't wear contact lenses, haven't had any trauma, and no discharge or vision changes. They're not on any medications that could cause this, and there's no history of similar issues before.

Socially, the patient doesn't smoke or drink. They have a daughter and are managing childcare alone while their partner is away. They're working and handling things well otherwise.

The patient's main request is to check if it's an infection and whether they need antibiotics or drops. They're concerned about it being contagious and affecting their daughter.

Objectively, the physical exam shows redness in both eyes, worse on the right, but no foreign body or discharge. Pupils are reactive, and the rest of the exam is normal.

The assessment is viral conjunctivitis, likely self-limiting. They've ruled out bacterial causes since there's no pus, and no other conditions like acute angle-closure glaucoma because there's no pain or vision issues.

The plan includes using artificial tears for comfort, advising against rubbing, and recommending warm compresses. They should follow up in two weeks if not better or sooner if symptoms worsen. No antibiotics are needed unless things change.

I need to make sure all these points are included in the SOAP note, following the telegraphic style without any fluff. I'll structure it with Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections, ensuring all critical points are covered concisely.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is presenting with an eye issue. They woke up on Tuesday morning with an irritated right eye. They mentioned it's red, thicker than the other eye, and feels like there's something in it, causing discomfort. They've been researching online and think it might be an infection but want to make sure it's not something else.

Looking at the positives, the patient has redness, especially in the right eye, which is worse than the left. They feel like there's a foreign body, and the eye is uncomfortable, though not painful. They can see normally, and there's no photophobia. The left eye is starting to show some redness too, indicating it might be spreading.

For negatives, the patient denies fever, cough, or shortness of breath. They don't wear contact lenses, haven't had any trauma, and no discharge or vision changes. They're not on any medications that could cause this, and there's no history of similar issues before.

Socially, the patient doesn't smoke or drink. They have a daughter and are managing childcare alone while their partner is away. They're working and handling things well otherwise.

The patient's main request is to check if it's an infection and whether they need antibiotics or drops. They're concerned about it being contagious and affecting their daughter.

Objectively, the physical exam shows redness in both eyes, worse on the right, but no foreign body or discharge. Pupils are reactive, and the rest of the exam is normal.

The assessment is viral conjunctivitis, likely self-limiting. They've ruled out bacterial causes since there's no pus, and no other conditions like acute angle-closure glaucoma because there's no pain or vision issues.

The plan includes using artificial tears for comfort, advising against rubbing, and recommending warm compresses. They should follow up in two weeks if not better or sooner if symptoms worsen. No antibiotics are needed unless things change.

I need to make sure all these points are included in the SOAP note, following the telegraphic style without any fluff. I'll structure it with Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections, ensuring all critical points are covered concisely.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

**Subjective:**
The patient has a red, irritated right eye that started on Tuesday. It feels like there's something in the eye, causing discomfort. She hasn't had similar issues before. She doesn't wear contacts, isn't using new cosmetics, and hasn't been sick recently. She's managing well with her daughter and work. She's concerned it might be contagious and wants advice on treatment, possibly antibiotics or eye drops.

**Objective:**
Vitals aren't mentioned, so I'll omit them. The physical exam shows redness in both eyes, worse on the right. The eyes are otherwise normal with no foreign bodies. Pupils react normally, and there's no discharge or vision changes.

**Assessment:**
The diagnosis is viral conjunctivitis. No signs of bacterial infection or other conditions like corneal abrasion.

**Plan:**
Recommend artificial tears for comfort, warm compresses, and avoiding rubbing. Advise follow-up in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. No antibiotics needed unless bacterial infection signs appear.

I need to ensure all negatives, social history, and patient requests are included. Also, keep the language telegraphic without full sentences.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is experiencing fatigue for two months. They mention sleeping a lot but waking up tired. They haven't called in sick but are less enthusiastic about work. They can still do their sports, like climbing and cycling, but notice more muscle pain and back pain. They also have morning stiffness but no joint pain. They don't snore, have no respiratory issues, good appetite, stable weight, normal bowel movements, and no other significant symptoms.

The patient is concerned about possible rheumatism or something wrong with their body. They request blood tests to check for anemia, thyroid issues, and inflammation. They have a family history of back problems but no history of joint issues themselves.

Vitals: BP 110/60, HR around 40-60, which is athletic. Physical exam shows no specific back tenderness, no pelvic pain, normal lungs, soft abdomen with active bowel sounds, no pain on palpation.

Now, I'll structure this into SOAP notes.

Subjective: Fatigue for two months, sleeping a lot, waking up tired, can still work and exercise, more muscle and back pain, morning stiffness, no joint pain, no weight loss, no night sweats, no fever, no respiratory issues, no chest pain, no palpitations, no abdominal pain, no change in bowel habits, no allergies. Social: No smoking, no alcohol. Request: Blood tests for anemia, thyroid, inflammation.

Objective: BP 110/60, HR 40-60, normal lungs, back exam normal, abdomen soft, no tenderness.

Assessment: Fatigue of unknown origin, possibly anemia, thyroid dysfunction, or inflammation. No evidence of rheumatoid arthritis or other chronic conditions.

Plan: Blood tests for CBC, TSH, CRP, ESR. Follow up in a week to discuss results. Advise to continue monitoring symptoms and contact if worse.

I need to make sure all negatives are included, social history is there, and the patient's request is explicit. Also, keep it telegraphic without full sentences.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, under the Subjective section, I need to capture the patient's symptoms, any negatives, social history, and their specific request or concerns. The patient is a 20-year-old student who's been experiencing headaches for about two months, worsening over time. The headaches are primarily on the right side but can generalize. They mention nausea but no vomiting, and sensitivity to light (glare) but no flashes. They've tried paracetamol and ibuprofen with some relief. Family history includes migraines (father) and possible cluster headaches (grandfather). The patient doesn't smoke, drinks occasionally, and exercises regularly. They're concerned it might be a migraine or cluster headache and want advice on managing it. The headaches are affecting their daily life, like missing out on social activities.

Next, the Objective section includes vital signs and physical exam findings. Blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 50 bpm, and the neurological exam shows cranial nerves intact, normal strength, and slightly off gait but otherwise normal.

For the Assessment, the provider suspects migraines given the symptoms and family history. They've ruled out cluster headaches and other serious conditions like tumors.

The Plan includes starting pain relief with paracetamol and ibuprofen as needed, advising to avoid triggers, keeping a headache diary, and scheduling a follow-up in four weeks. They also mention providing information from thuisarts.nl and using the diary to identify patterns.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format as specified, ensuring telegraphic style with all necessary details included without fluff. I'll make sure to include pertinent negatives, social history, the patient's request, and specific plan details with safety netting.

For the Assessment, the provider suspects migraines given the symptoms and family history. They've ruled out cluster headaches and other serious conditions like tumors.

The Plan includes starting pain relief with paracetamol and ibuprofen as needed, advising to avoid triggers, keeping a headache diary, and scheduling a follow-up in four weeks. They also mention providing information from thuisarts.nl and using the diary to identify patterns.

I need to structure all this into the JSON format as specified, ensuring telegraphic style with all necessary details included without fluff. I'll make sure to include pertinent negatives, social history, the patient's request, and specific plan details with safety netting.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

**Subjective:**
The patient is a 20-year-old male with headaches for two months, worsening over time. The headaches are primarily on the right side but can generalize. He experiences nausea but no vomiting. He has photophobia (glare) but no visual auras. He uses paracetamol and ibuprofen with some relief. Family history includes migraines (father) and cluster headaches (grandfather). He's a student, doesn't smoke or use drugs, drinks alcohol occasionally. He's physically active, exercising four times a week. The headaches impact his daily life, causing him to avoid activities like volleyball. His main concerns are whether this is a migraine or cluster headache and what to do about it.

**Objective:**
Vitals: BP 120/80, pulse 50. Neurological exam shows cranial nerves intact, normal strength, normal Romberg's test, but slight difficulty with heel-to-toe walking. 

**Assessment:**
Likely migraine, given the symptoms and family history. No signs of more serious conditions like tumors.

**Plan:**
Educate on migraines, start pain relief early with paracetamol and ibuprofen, keep a headache diary, schedule follow-up in four weeks, and advise to return sooner if worse.

Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring telegraphic style and completeness.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through the transcript step by step to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is presenting with a spot on their neck that they've noticed for about two weeks. They initially thought it was a wart but now are unsure. The spot started after shaving, which caused a small wound, and they also mention an insect bite in the same area. The spot is described as swollen and redder, with scabs falling off periodically. It itches but doesn't hurt. They've had similar spots before, which were warts, but nothing else. They have a family history of skin issues, like actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma on their father's side.

The patient is worried because they looked it up online and saw possibilities of skin cancer, though they're aware they're not elderly. They're requesting advice on what to do about the spot. They also mentioned a separate issue with knee pain that's been ongoing for a few months, worse after running, but that's not the main focus of this visit.

The physician examined the spot, describing it as a raised, pinkish-red lesion about half a centimeter with a redder center. There's no scab currently, and no scratching was done. No similar spots elsewhere. The physician suggests consulting a dermatologist, possibly via e-consultation, and discussing treatment options like freezing or removal. They plan to follow up on Friday.

Now, I'll structure this into the SOAP note, making sure to follow the telegraphic style, include all pertinent negatives, social context, the patient's request, and the plan details. I'll also ensure laterality is specified where needed and capture severity and comparisons.

For the Subjective section, I'll include the symptoms, negatives, social history, and the patient's request. The Objective will cover the physical exam findings. The Assessment will note the possible diagnoses and ruled-out conditions. The Plan will outline the next steps, including the referral, treatment options, and follow-up.

I need to make sure I don't omit any specific findings and keep the language concise without fluff. Also, I'll avoid inferring diagnoses not mentioned and stick strictly to the information given.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a spot on the neck for two weeks, initially thought to be a wart but now uncertain. It's itchy, swollen, and red, possibly from an insect bite. There's a history of similar spots (warts) but no others currently. Family history includes skin issues, possibly actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma on the father's side. The patient is worried about malignancy, especially melanoma, but isn't over seventy. They used Google Lens and found concerning results. The spot affects sleep and work due to discomfort. They request removal, preferably freezing. Also, they mentioned knee pain but it's not the main focus now.

Next, the Objective section. The spot is 0.5 cm, raised, pinkish-red with a redder center. No scab currently, no scratching. No similar spots elsewhere, no lymph nodes. The assessment is uncertain, possibilities include pyogenic granuloma or atypical mole. The plan is to send a photo to a dermatologist, discuss removal options like freezing or excision, and schedule a follow-up.

Now, I need to ensure all critical points are included: negatives, social history, patient's request, and plan details. The patient didn't mention smoking or alcohol, so I'll note that as ""No smoking/alcohol."" The request is clearly for removal. The plan includes specific actions and follow-up.

I should also check for any missing elements. The patient didn't mention fever, headache, or other systemic symptoms, so I'll include those negatives. Social history about smoking and alcohol is covered. The patient's request is explicit, so that's included. The plan has specific steps and safety netting.

I think I've covered all necessary points. Now, I'll structure it into the JSON format as specified.

Alright, I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me go through each section step by step.

Starting with the Subjective section. The patient has a sore throat for three days, fever this morning, and a cough last week. They've taken paracetamol and ibuprofen but the pain is unbearable. No shortness of breath, runny nose, or cough now. No one around them is sick, but a friend had an abscess, making them concerned about needing antibiotics. Impact on daily life isn't explicitly mentioned, but the pain is affecting swallowing.

Next, the Objective section. Vitals include a fever of 38.3°C. Physical exam shows slightly red pharyngeal arch, enlarged tonsils with slough, but no abscess. Ears are normal, lymph nodes are small and non-pathological. Lungs have vesicular breath sounds, and oxygen saturation is 98%.

For the Assessment, the diagnosis is viral pharyngitis. Ruled out bacterial pharyngitis and abscess. No signs of complications like respiratory distress.

The Plan includes continuing paracetamol and ibuprofen, staying hydrated, using cold compresses or popsicles, and monitoring for red flags like difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath. Follow-up if symptoms worsen or persist beyond a few days.

I need to ensure all critical points are included without fluff, using telegraphic style. Also, make sure negatives are grouped and specific findings are detailed.

Okay, so I need to create a SOAP note based on the provided transcript. Let me start by reading through the transcript carefully to extract all the necessary information.

First, the patient is presenting with a sore throat for three days, along with a fever this morning. They also mention having a cough last week, but it's gone now. They've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen, but the sore throat is unbearable, especially when swallowing. They don't have a runny nose, shortness of breath, or cough anymore. They're worried about having an abscess because a friend had one.

On physical exam, the doctor checked the ears, throat, and lungs. The ears were normal except for some redness in the right ear canal. The throat showed red pharyngeal arches, slightly enlarged tonsils with slough, but no abscess. The patient had a fever of 38.3°C, but normal oxygen saturation. Lymph nodes were slightly enlarged but not pathological.

The assessment is likely a viral pharyngitis, no abscess. The plan includes continuing paracetamol and ibuprofen, staying hydrated, and using cold compresses or popsicles. They should follow up if symptoms worsen or if they develop shortness of breath or inability to swallow.

Now, I need to structure this into the SOAP note. Subjective should include symptoms, negatives, social history (though not mentioned, so I'll note no smoking/alcohol), and the patient's request for antibiotics. Objective includes vitals and physical findings. Assessment is the diagnosis and ruled-out conditions. Plan lists the treatment and follow-up.

I should make sure to use telegraphic style, include all pertinent negatives, specify laterality where needed, and capture severity. Also, ensure no fluff and only include what's in the transcript without inferring anything else.
