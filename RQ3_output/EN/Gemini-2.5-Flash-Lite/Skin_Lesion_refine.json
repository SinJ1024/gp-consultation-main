  "Subjective": "Spot on neck, ~2 weeks. Started as wound post-shaving, possibly insect bite. Thought wart initially, now unsure. Scabs fall off, reform. Itchy. No pain. No similar spots elsewhere. No history of skin malignancies in family, but father's side has sun-related skin issues (actinic keratosis, SCC, BCC, melanoma mentioned but patient unsure). Searched online, concerned about skin cancer. Request: Wants spot removed. Also, knee pain for months, post-running, lingers days. Soccer okay. No time to discuss knee today.",
  "Objective": "Neck lesion: Raised, ~0.5 cm. Pinkish-red with slightly redder center. No visible flaking or scab currently. No palpable lymphadenopathy in neck. Otherwise, neck clear except for freckles.",
  "Assessment": "Neck lesion: Differential includes pyogenic granuloma, atypical nevus. Needs dermatology consult for definitive diagnosis and management. Knee pain: Likely overuse injury, post-running. Needs separate appointment.",
  "Plan": "1. E-consultation to dermatology with photo of neck lesion. \n2. Patient to call clinic on Friday between 12-12:30 PM for dermatology advice. If unavailable, call before 10 AM or after 3 PM. Voicemail acceptable.\n3. Discussed treatment options: cryotherapy (preferred by patient), surgical excision, curettage with biopsy.\n4. Advised to schedule separate appointment for knee pain evaluation."
