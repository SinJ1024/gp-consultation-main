  "Subjective": "Right leg pain radiating from back down posterior thigh and lateral lower leg to foot x 1.5 weeks, worsening. Pain all day, no specific triggers. Severe discomfort, unable to sleep. Tried max doses paracetamol/ibuprofen, no relief. Reduced sensation/dullness on lateral right lower leg. Occasional tingling in same area. Strength intact, but pain limits movement. No saddle anesthesia or bowel/bladder incontinence. Temporarily stopped working (supermarket, heavy lifting). ICE: Wants to get rid of pain, worried about severity.",
  "Objective": "General: Appears in pain on movement to exam table. Musculoskeletal: Tenderness noted more towards buttock/posterior aspect. No gross abnormalities of legs. Right leg raise elicits pain. Left leg raise normal. Sensation: Dullness noted on right lateral lower leg compared to left. Strength: 5/5 bilateral lower extremities, though right leg movement painful. Reflexes: Normal bilateral lower extremities. No saddle anesthesia.",
  "Assessment": "Lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to herniated disc. Nerve pain. Ruled out: Cauda equina syndrome.",
  "Plan": "1. Explanation of herniated disc and nerve pain. 2. Start Pregabalin (dose TBD, build up slowly). Caution: driving restrictions (at least 1 week after starting/titrating, or if side effects). Goal: improve sleep and pain. 3. Recommend physiotherapy for exercises to decompress nerve. 4. Surgery/imaging (CT/MRI) not indicated currently. 5. Safety netting: Contact immediately if worsening symptoms, saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, or significant loss of leg strength. 6. Follow-up: Telephone appointment in 1 week to assess pain relief efficacy."
