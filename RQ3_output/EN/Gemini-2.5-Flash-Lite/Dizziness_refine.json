  "Plan": "1. Reassurance regarding benign nature of BPPV, not indicative of tumor.\n2. Epley maneuver performed in office today.\n3. Instructions for home exercises via thuisarts.nl.\n4. Advised to avoid provoking movements initially, gradually increase head movement as tolerated.\n5. Safety netting: Return if symptoms worsen significantly, new neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, vision changes, severe headache), or persistent vomiting.\n6. Follow-up: As needed."
