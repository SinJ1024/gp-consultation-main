  "Subjective": "Spot on neck, 2 weeks duration. Started as wound post-shaving, possibly insect bite. Initially thought wart, now uncertain. Itching present. No pain. Scabs fall off intermittently. No similar spots elsewhere. No fever, no cough, no shortness of breath. No history of skin cancer in family, but father's side has sun-related skin issues (actinic keratosis, SCC, BCC, melanoma mentioned). Patient worried about skin cancer after online search. Request: Wants spot removed. Knee pain, few months duration, post-running, lingers few days. Soccer okay. No time to discuss knee today.",
  "Objective": "Neck spot: ~0.5 cm, raised, pinkish-red with central redder area. No visible scab or flaking currently. No palpable lymphadenopathy in neck. No other suspicious spots on neck.",
  "Assessment": "Neck spot: Differential diagnosis includes pyogenic granuloma, atypical nevus, or other benign lesion. Referral to dermatology for definitive diagnosis and management. Knee pain: Musculoskeletal pain, likely overuse related. Requires separate appointment.",
  "Plan": "1. E-consultation to dermatology for neck spot. \n2. Patient to call clinic on Friday between 10 AM - 3 PM for dermatology feedback. \n3. If unable to reach patient, will leave voicemail. \n4. Discussed treatment options: cryotherapy (preferred by patient), surgical excision, curettage with biopsy. \n5. Knee pain: Schedule separate appointment for evaluation. \n6. Safety Netting: Return if spot changes significantly, develops pain, or bleeds."
