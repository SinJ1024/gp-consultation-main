  "Subjective": "Dizziness for 3 days, onset upon waking. Primarily a room-spinning sensation (vertigo), with some light-headedness. Triggered by head movements; improved by sitting still. Associated with mild nausea and transient palpitations during episodes. Interferes with daily activities, requires sitting down. No vomiting, headache, hearing loss, tinnitus, speech difficulty, or syncope. No true focal weakness. Recent mild cold. Social: No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Request: Wants diagnosis and treatment for dizziness. Concern: Fears a brain tumor, as a friend was diagnosed with one after similar symptoms.",
  "Objective": "Vitals: BP 110/70, HR 62. Neuro Exam: Cranial nerves V, VII, XII intact and symmetric. Motor strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities. No pronator drift. Cerebellar exam normal, including finger-to-nose and stable gait/tandem walk. Vestibular Exam: Smooth pursuit intact without nystagmus. Head Impulse Test (HIT) negative bilaterally. Dix-Hallpike maneuver positive, provoking intense vertigo, nausea, and visible nystagmus; symptoms more intense on one side.",
  "Assessment": "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Brain tumor ruled out.",
  "Plan": "1. Explained diagnosis of BPPV due to vestibular crystals. 2. Reassured patient that findings are not consistent with a brain tumor. 3. Performed Epley maneuver in-office. 4. Provided instructions for performing Epley maneuver at home via patient education resources. 5. Explained condition can resolve on its own but maneuver can speed recovery."
