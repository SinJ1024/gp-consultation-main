Subjective:
For several months, I have been experiencing palpitations and rapid breathing, which have worsened in the past two weeks. Symptoms mainly occur during moments of rest, such as in the bath or before going to sleep. No chest pain, no irregular heartbeat, no dizziness, no light-headedness. Sometimes shortness of breath when breathing rapidly, also at work. Difficulty falling asleep due to worrying about work, averaging 6 hours of sleep per night. Full-time 38-hour working week, often longer days. Request for help: Could there be a somatic cause and would it be wise to talk to a professional?
