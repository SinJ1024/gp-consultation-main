Subjective:
Woke up on Tuesday morning with an irritated eye. Initially thought there was a hair or speck of dust in it, but found nothing. Eye has become redder and thicker compared to the other eye. Feels like there is something in the eye, but no pain. No contact lenses. Light is not particularly painful. No other illnesses or symptoms. Since yesterday, redness in the other eye as well. Request for help: Want to know if it is a normal eye infection and if eye drops or antibiotics are needed.


Objective:
Redness and swelling of the right eye. No foreign objects visible. Both eyes react normally to light.


Evaluation:
Viral conjunctivitis


Plan:
Explanation of viral conjunctivitis. Advice not to rub and to use artificial tears for relief. Rinse with lukewarm water if necessary. Return if symptoms persist after 2 weeks or if they worsen (more pain, pus, stuck eye, poor vision).
