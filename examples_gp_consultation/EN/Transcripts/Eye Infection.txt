Hi. Come sit down. Yes. Good morning.

Thank you.

Tell me. How are you?

Yes. Fine, actually. Except I'm... I think it was Tuesday morning when I woke up with a slightly irritated eye.

That's not nice.

No. And I started rubbing it a bit. Because at first I thought, well, maybe there's a speck of dust or something in it. A hair. But I can't see anything.

No. Because you've been looking at it yourself.

Yes, yes. And it's actually just gotten redder.

Okay. 

You can see all those little red veins starting to appear now.

Yes. That's right. I can see it from here.

And it's thicker than the other eye. So yes. I've already done a bit of research online. It looks like a normal eye infection. But maybe there's something else going on. So I thought, I'll just get it checked out.

That's actually why you made an appointment to see if it's what I think it is. Or is it something else?

Do you just need to take a look, or do I need eye drops or antibiotics? I have no idea. I've never had this before.

No?

No, no. Never anything with my eye.

And you have a daughter?

Yes, that's right.

She hasn't been cuddling with you and with...

Yes, she has.

Fortunately. But not like a nail in the eye, I don't know about those kinds of things?

No, I can't really think of anything that could have caused this.

Didn't anything happen beforehand that you can think of?

No, I don't have any other day cream either. No other mascara. Nothing at all, actually.

No, no. 

No, it was really after waking up that I thought about it. It feels like I have a hair or a speck of dust in my eye all the time. I keep wanting to touch it. 

I'll take a look in a minute. It's better not to do that. But I understand how difficult it is.

Yes.

Hey, can you see properly?

Yes.

You don't wear lenses?

No.

No, no. 

What does happen is that when I squeeze my eyes shut really hard, like really squeeze them together, then I do feel a kind of pain. But otherwise, I only see that it's red when I look in the mirror, and it's very different from the other eye.

Yes, yes. 

And so I feel like there's something in my eye all the time. Just a stick or something.

Can you see normally?

Yes. 

Light isn't extra painful or anything?

No, no. I can see normally and it doesn't hurt. Except that it just feels uncomfortable.


Annoying.


Yes. Annoying.


Okay. Otherwise, you're fine. You're not sick with the flu or anything like that?

No, no. 

Strange things. Everything's fine at home?

Yes.

Good.

Definitely.

And you're managing well with your little one?

Yes.

Because you're working too?


Yes, that's right. No, but it's going really well. My boyfriend happens to be away at the moment. He's on holiday. He managed to plan it so he could visit a friend and also catch the Singapore Formula One race.

Well, well. So you are. And then you get this.

Yes, far away for a while. Really the first time. Ten days alone too. With the little one, and then I think I'll have this.

Then you'll be fine. Even on your own?

Yes, yes, definitely. Only I also thought, yes. Maybe it would be a good idea to have it checked out. Because suppose it really starts to hurt or gets worse. Or it's contagious.

Also for, what's her name again?

Isa.


Isa. Yes, I'll take a look at your eye first. Just look straight ahead and I'll look at your eye. I'm also going to pull your eyelid down a little. Then you can look up.

Yes.

Okay. Then I'll look at the inside. I can see the redness you mentioned. I'll shine my light on it a little. I don't see anything on the bottom. The hairs are fine. Then you can look down for a moment. I'll lift your upper eyelid. It often feels a little uncomfortable. But I don't see anything unusual there either. I can see the redness you mentioned. You can look straight ahead again. I'm going to shine my light in your eye. So just keep looking straight ahead. I'm shining my light and your light. You can see that your pupils are reacting normally. So that's all fine too. Yes. Actually, as I see it now, I think you've already given yourself a good diagnosis.

Yes. 


This is indeed an inflammation of the surface layer of your eye. This causes redness, and the cause is almost always a virus. And in your case, I think that's what it is. I see some redness on the other side too.

Yes. It really started yesterday.

I only looked at one of your eyes. Of course, I should check both eyes. But it started yesterday.

Yes, at first it was a really big difference. Yes, when I looked in the mirror, I saw one eye that was really small and completely red, and one eye that was normal. And now the other one is starting. So it started yesterday too.

It may have become infected as well.

Yes.

Well, you know. Yes, that would be a shame. Annoying. It means that you may have discomfort in that eye for a little longer, while it heals. Because this will go away on its own.

Yes. 
That can sometimes take an annoyingly long time. If you're unlucky, it can take two weeks. But usually it's much shorter. However, I can't promise in advance how it will turn out for you. As you said yourself: don't rub it. Try to stick to that. It might help. 

My mother also said to rinse it. But then I think, yes.

Rinsing. What, it wouldn't work. It's a lot of fiddling around and hassle.

Yes.

And it doesn't add much value. What you can do to soothe it a little. Because it is a bit irritating, you can use a drop of artificial tears every now and then.

You can get it at the kruidvat. Just put a few drops on. It soothes it a bit. But it doesn't make it better any faster.

No. I only have it in the morning. Then it's a bit stuck. So I use a cotton pad and some water.

A little lukewarm water.

Yes.

You can just use tap water. Ah. It doesn't need to be boiled.

Okay.

We haven't done that yet in the Netherlands. Some people make a big deal out of it. But it doesn't really matter.

Fine. 

So that's it, and yes, that's basically the story, and I expect that too. Probably a little earlier on the left, I hope it doesn't get too bad on the right.

How long should I wait? Is there a certain time frame, like if it's still not gone after four weeks?

I would wait two weeks. If you still have problems after two weeks, then come and see me. Because that's actually longer than we think it should take. So you don't have to wait four weeks. As far as I'm concerned. Or if other things come up. If it suddenly starts to hurt more or if there is more pus. Of course, there could be a bacterial infection. Possibly causing an additional infection. And then you have antibiotic drops that you can use. But that's actually almost never the case.

Okay.

But suppose something crazy happens. Pain or pus. Or that it gets stuck shut even more.

Yes.

Or if you start to see things. Yes, always call right away.

Okay. 

But I don't expect that to happen.

Well, that's fine.  

So I won't worry you too much about it.

Thank you for taking a look.

Yes. You're welcome, and keep enjoying yourself.

Yes. No. It'll be fine. Okay.

Bye. 

Well, bye.
