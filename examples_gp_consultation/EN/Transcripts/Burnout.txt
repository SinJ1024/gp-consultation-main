Welcome.

Thank you.

I understand from the doctor's assistants that you came in because of some stress-related symptoms. Could you tell me a little more about that?

Yes, I have a very busy job at the moment. And I notice that there is a lot of tension in my body. A lot. My muscles are very stiff and sometimes I can breathe very quickly. Then I really feel my heart beating. And I do correlate it, because I do have a very demanding job at the moment. I think that's what's causing it. But it does bother me a lot.

And what kind of job do you do?

I just graduated as a doctor. And I started working in internal medicine.

Oh. We're colleagues. How nice. And how do you like it? Except that it's very busy.

Yes. I really enjoy it. But there's so much understaffing. We're often asked to do extra shifts and the days are really long, and sometimes I still feel really unsure whether I'm missing things. But there are also days that go really well and then I get a lot of energy from it. But I don't really want to work in a hospital later on. So I'm doing this in the hope of becoming a good GP later on. I find this really tough. And it really bothers me.

Yes. What exactly are the things you find really tough and how do you notice that it bothers you so much in your daily life?

It happens so often that you arrive to the morning handover and someone is ill again, and can people in that department help out, and I notice my heart rate accelerating and that I actually want to say no. But we have to do it together. So then I have that inner struggle that causes a lot of unrest.

Yes. That seems very difficult indeed. Yes, yes. Because do you often find yourself thinking that you actually want to say no, but you can't?

Well, it does happen sometimes. I am someone who can be a bit avoidant. I often do what others want because I enjoy it. I'm happy that the other person likes it.

Yes.

But it never causes me any physical discomfort. No.

And what do you do when you get heart palpitations, for example, and you don't feel very comfortable at work?

I do notice that I drink less coffee then. Because it makes my heart palpitations worse. That helps. And if you're with a nice colleague and you're just having fun together, that breaks it. Then you just feel more relaxed again. And that can also help in the evening. But it is difficult. Because you don't want to do too much either. A lot is already demanded of me. How do you get enough rest?

And is there anything you're worried about at the moment?

Well, on the one hand, I know that this is just a temporary phase and that the job will end eventually. But my health is also important to me, and this situation is continuing. So I think that I'm doing the right thing by persevering.

Is that what's on your mind in particular?

Yes.

And is there a specific reason why you thought you really need to see a doctor now? That's my point. Yes. You think there might be something physical going on. Maybe anaemia. Or would it be a good idea to talk to the practice nurses? I'm not sure. But you shouldn't just carry on like this?

No, indeed. Because do you feel alone in this, in those thoughts and emotions and the symptoms you have?

Well, I can cope, I still live with housemates and they are also doctors.

That's nice.

It's very nice.

And they probably understand you.
Yes. 

They are also in the profession.

Yes, and anyway, many of my friends are doctors too. And colleagues and everyone else. That's a lot of pressure too. So yes, in that sense, yes. Everyone around me understands it well and I talk about it too.

So I hear you saying that you have a good support system in that regard. That you have the opportunity to discuss these things in your private life and get things off your chest.

Yes.

That's very good to hear.

Certainly.

And I hear you saying that too. If I may summarise briefly: you are here today at the consultation hour with complaints, physical complaints and fatigue. And your main question is whether there could be a somatic cause underlying this. Is it possible to rule that out? And your second question: what I actually heard you say is that it might be wise to look further into this. To discuss it with a professional?

Yes.

Yes, because is there anything specific that you yourself have thought about that you would like to discuss with, for example, a nurse practicioner?

I think so. This job demands a lot from everyone. But some people are more affected by it than others. I find it difficult to say no. Or if I say: that's not possible. Then I feel like I'm letting my colleagues down with the work. So then you're also affected by that. So it's not that I said no.

A bit of guilt, you mean? To understand your complaint a bit better, I'm going to ask you some specific questions first. Then I'll examine you physically. And at the end, we'll make a plan together. Is that a good idea?

Yes. Sounds good to me.

Okay. You already mentioned a number of physical complaints you have. Can you describe in more detail what you feel when you have them?

Yes, well, I find those heart palpitations very unpleasant, and they often occur when, for example, I enjoy taking a bath in the evening and then suddenly feel them when I go to bed at night.

So it can happen spontaneously.

Yes.

Yes, and do you also experience this when you exert yourself?

No.

Okay. And what happens at such moments? Are there specific thoughts you have, for example, or is there something else that provokes or triggers it?

I think it's mainly when I take a moment to relax. For example, in the bath. So that you can completely switch off from work and be with yourself.

You notice that when you rest, the physical symptoms appear. Do you also have chest pain?

No. I don't have chest pain.

And do you feel that your heartbeat is irregular?

No. It's not irregular.

It's regular. But it's faster and really noticeable.


Yes, you can feel it in your neck. Sometimes you can hear it a little bit too.


That's right. And do you have any symptoms of dizziness or light-headedness?

No.

None of that. Okay, shortness of breath?

Well, yes. Sometimes I notice that I'm breathing very quickly at those moments or at other times. And that can feel a bit like shortness of breath. Yes.

And when do these moments occur? Even during those moments of rest?

Yes, yes. But it can also happen when I'm in the toilet at work. And then I think: wow, I'm breathing really fast.

So unconsciously. Yes, okay. I was also curious, you indicated that you are now starting to experience problems. Can you describe specifically which moments in your daily life you encounter this? What are the specific obstacles?

These complaints are more frequent. It used to be once in a while. But now it's almost every day. Then you want it to go away. But it doesn't. So then I can't do it. Then it keeps you awake when you want to sleep and you think: yes, I have to get up early again tomorrow and it's going to be another tough day. So then I'm annoyed that I can't fall asleep.

Exactly. Do you also suffer from sleep problems?

Well, sometimes I have trouble falling asleep. Because once I'm asleep, I feel fine.

Then you can sleep through the night. And falling asleep, what happens when you're in bed, for example? What time do you go to bed, approximately?

Yes. I try to go to bed on time. Because I have to get up early again. So I go to bed between ten and half past ten.

And what happens when you're lying in bed?

Well, I think about what tomorrow will be like. Which departments will I be working in? Or just the one I'm assigned to. Those are the thoughts that go through my mind.

You are worrying and fretting about the next day. And uncertainty in particular comes out.

Yes, uncertainty.

Okay. How many hours can you sleep then? What time do you have to get out of bed?

I usually have to get up around quarter past six.

But then you get an average of seven or eight hours.

Yes, sometimes I lie awake until midnight or so. I think it's often around six hours.

Six hours.

Six hours of sleep.

And on the days when you're not working, do you notice that you sleep better and wake up more rested?

Then you notice that I'm just tired. So I sleep for a long time. And that I can indeed fall asleep a little faster.

And how many hours a week do you work?

Yes, full-time. So that's a thirty-eight-hour contract. Those are often longer days.

Yes, yes. And those symptoms you feel. How long do they last? When they come on so spontaneously.

Well, that can happen, sometimes for half an hour or so. Yes, I think something like that. 

And then it goes away spontaneously. Or do you have to do something about it?

No. Often it just goes away all at once or something.

Okay. If I may summarise briefly, I hear you saying that since when have you been noticing this?

Well, yes. It has gradually gotten worse. But I have been experiencing it for a few months now. However, it has only become a daily occurrence in the last two weeks, I think.

The last two weeks. Okay. So, for months you have had some complaints of palpitations and rapid breathing. Which now seems to have increased in the last two weeks. It's affecting your daily life. It's getting in the way. And you suspected it might be due to your busy work schedule. But you're wondering, can we rule out any physical causes? To do that, I'm going to examine you first. Please come over to the examination table and take a seat. I'll start by doing a few standard checks. I'll measure your heart rate and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is good. One hundred and twenty over sixty. And I see that your heart rate is around sixty-five per minute. That's good. Calm. Your oxygen level is ninety-eight per cent and you are breathing nicely and calmly at fourteen per minute. I will listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take off your shirt? I will start by listening to your back. Breathe in and out through your mouth. Very good. I don't hear anything unusual in your lungs. There is good breath sound across all lung fields. I don't hear any abnormal sounds. Now I'll listen to the front. And your heart. Please breathe as you normally would. Well, I hear normal heart sounds, nothing unusual. No murmurs. Do you also have abdominal complaints?

No. That's not an issue.

Not? Okay. Then I will skip the abdominal examination for now. You may get dressed again and then we will discuss what we are going to do. Well, I have heard you say a number of things and I have now examined you. The physical examination was completely fine. So, in that respect, I want to reassure you. I think you may be a little stressed at the moment because of work. And that can cause these kinds of symptoms, of course. What I would like to do is conduct an additional examination. Specifically, a blood test. Because you wondered whether anaemia, for example, could cause this. And you are absolutely right. So we can rule out a number of somatic causes. So I will definitely test your haemoglobin. The thyroid values and liver and kidney function. To see how that goes. I mean, what the values are. And then we will have ruled out a number of things. And coming back to your second question. Would it be a good idea to discuss this with a professional? I think that would be wise. If you are open to that. Then you can make an appointment with our mental health nurse. And you can actually do that today. You can go to the reception desk today to make an appointment. While you wait for the blood test results. So you don't necessarily have to wait for those first. 
Because I suspect that this is not unusual in principle. If you have had a blood test, we will have the results within two working days and you can call the practice to check the results or look them up online in the portal. So you can see them there too. Well, I would say: see how the consultations with the practice nurse goes. If you still have questions after that, or if your symptoms are getting worse and you're feeling a bit worried, you're always welcome to come back for another appointment. Did you have any questions about anything that wasn't clear during the conversation?

No, I'm glad we're going to take some blood and that I can talk to a practice nurse.
I really appreciate that. Is there anything else I should take into account for tomorrow when I go back to work?

That's a very good question indeed. In any case, I would advise you, and I think that's probably because we're colleagues, to take a little bit of care. In a period of overload like this. On the verge of burnout. It is very important to actively build moments of relaxation into your life. So that a few times a week you do things that really give you energy. And they don't have to be big undertakings. Enjoying a nice cup of coffee at your favourite coffee shop is already a moment of relief for your body. Or giving a friend you get along with a call. Treat yourself to a nice walk or go for a swim. Things that actually give you energy. You can be as creative as you like. The most important thing is to maintain regularity in your life. So the fact that you still go to work in the morning and get up. Trying to go to bed on time in the evening is also very important. And if your hospital has an occupational health and safety service, it is always wise to make an appointment with the occupational health doctor to ask for some tips or to see if there is anything in your contract, for example.

Whether the schedules can be adjusted to give you a little more peace of mind. And I think you yourself are in the best position to judge where the balance between work and private life lies. Working hard, but also relaxing and unwinding. Those are the things I would recommend in the first instance.

Thank you very much.

You're welcome. Good luck with it. Again, if you still have any concerns or questions about it, you can always contact us again.

That's great. Thank you very much.

Yes. You're welcome.
