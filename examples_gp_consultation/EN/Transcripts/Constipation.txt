Let's see if he's keeping track of the time. Good. You're here for your appointment today. I see you've already told the assistant about your complaint. But perhaps you'd like to tell me about it yourself.

Yes. For several months now, I've been having trouble passing hard stools. They hardly come out at all. So much so that sometimes I don't go to the toilet for two or three days. And it just keeps going on. So yes. That's why I'm here.

Okay. And is this something that has changed recently, or have you been suffering from it for a long time?

No. It's been going on for about three months now.

Okay.

Yes, so I don't go to the toilet for three days and then I have quite difficult bowel movements because it's so hard.

Yes, that's unpleasant. What is your question about that? What would you like?

I would like to know if I should be concerned about this. Yes, or what can I do about it?

Yes, of course.

By making it softer.

Yes, yes, okay. Then I have a few more questions about that. Because you say: I sometimes don't have a bowel movement for a few days. Do you also have abdominal pain?

Yes. I have abdominal pain. I mainly have abdominal cramps.

Okay.

And yes. It is quite painful when pressed.

Yes. Okay. And do you also feel bloated?

Yes. My stomach is a bit more swollen than usual.

And can you eat and drink normally?

Yes. I can eat normally.

Okay. And has anything changed in your eating habits in the last three months?

Not really. I already eat very little.

Hm Okay. 

So with little appetite, I don't eat very much. But that's always been the case.

Yes, okay. 

I haven't eaten or drunk more or less than usual.

And are you losing weight?

Yes. I am underweight. So yes. I actually already am. I actually already weigh very little. I'm not at a normal weight yet. I haven't lost any more weight.

Haven't lost any more weight. But you've been struggling with your weight for a while.
Which is actually too low. Okay, yes. Has anyone ever looked into that? With a dietician, for example?

Well, when I was little, I did go to the doctor for that. But it runs in the family a bit.

Oh, okay. 

No research has ever been done on that.

Okay. Would you like further help with that?

Yes, actually. In the past. I would like that. I notice that there has been some improvement.

Okay.

oh well. 

Hmm, okay. Well, maybe that's something to pay attention to. And when you do go to the toilet to have a bowel movement, is there any blood?

No. No blood.

No blood. Okay, okay. And have you tried anything yourself to make your stools softer again?

Well, I was told at home that I could take a spoonful of olive oil.

Yes, yes. 

That did make it softer, but I'm wondering if it's a permanent solution.

Exactly, yes. 

Okay. So you learned that from your family. Am I right? Are there others who suffer from these kinds of complaints?

No. I'm the only one with bowel problems. 


Yes, okay. 

My sister has ulcerative colitis.

Okay. Yes, is that something else that's on your mind? Whether you might have something like that?

No. She has some other symptoms.


They usually have other symptoms, yes. Okay, no, clearly. No, exactly. That's also annoying. Let's see. Well, urination. How's that going? Is it any different than usual?


No, that's fine.


That's the same. Okay, and what else? Your periods. Are they regular?

Yes, I started menstruating later in life. But they are regular.

Okay, okay, okay. Then I'd like to examine you. Can you come over here on the couch? And then you can bare your stomach. I'll take a look at your abdomen and then listen to it. I hear normal bowel sounds. Do you feel bloated? Is your abdomen a bit rounder? That's also a bloated feeling. Maybe you've noticed that. Okay, okay. Then I'll tap your abdomen a little.

I hear varying tympani. Then I'll feel it for a moment. First at the back. Does it hurt? Here, and then I'll feel the renal lodges.

No.

No, okay. And then we'll move to the front. Then I'll feel the top of your abdomen. Does it hurt there?

No.

No, and then we'll move to the bottom right. Is it painful there?

No.

And then we'll move to the bottom left. Is it sensitive here?

Sensitive, yes.

Yes. Okay. I'll tap there again. I can hear some dampening there too. Okay, yes. Clear. Yes, you can get off the examination table now and we'll discuss it further.

Yes.

Well, taking everything into account. Your question is, of course: could it be something serious? Or what could it be? Fortunately, I don't hear any alarm bells. But I do hear an unpleasant pattern where you skip a few days of bowel movements and then experience quite a lot of pain when passing stool. I can well imagine that the stool becomes very hard. Given your age, I'm actually thinking more along the lines of irritable bowel syndrome. We see that quite often, and sometimes it can lead to very loose stools. So almost diarrhoea and a lot of abdominal pain. But sometimes it can also lead to constipation. So that it becomes very firm and hard. This can also cause abdominal pain and a bloated or distended abdomen. So what I want to try is to soften the stool. I will give you some fibre sachets. Psyllium fibre. You can take these with plenty of water.

Okay. 

You can use them every day. So I'm going to prescribe them for you. You can use them consistently every day for the next six weeks. Then we'll evaluate the results together in six weeks.

Yes, fine. 

If, in the meantime, you notice that your abdominal pain is getting worse, or you develop a fever, or you suddenly see a lot of blood in your stool, then I may want to see you sooner. So please let me know.

Yes, okay.

Very good. Do you have any questions about that?

No. Everything is clear.

And shall we perhaps talk more about that dietitian next time?

Yes, please.

Okay. Let's do that.

Yes. 

Well, have a nice day. Okay, bye.
