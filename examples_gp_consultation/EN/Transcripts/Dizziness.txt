Good afternoon. I see you're here to see me about dizziness.

Yes, that's right.

Tell me, how can I help you?

I've been feeling extremely dizzy for a few days now. It's really driving me crazy.

Oh dear, that's awful. How unpleasant.

Yes, it is.

Yes, yes, well, can you tell me a little more about it?

Well, it was three days ago that I woke up and suddenly felt extremely dizzy when I got out of bed. And it hasn't really improved since then.


No. Oh dear. Well, what do you hope I can do for you?


Well, I'm just really scared that it's something serious and I just want to get rid of the dizziness. Because it's stopping me from doing much.


No, no, well. I can imagine that it's difficult for you. If I understand correctly, you've been suffering from dizziness for three days now and you're worried about it. You want to know what it is and you want to get rid of it.


Yes, that's right. 


Would you mind if I asked you a few more questions about it?


Of course not.


Yes, did you wake up with the dizziness?

Yes, yes, that's how it started.

And the dizziness. Is it more of a light-headed feeling or do you really feel like the room is spinning around you?

A bit of both. But more like the room is spinning around me.

Yes, and does that happen when your eyes are open, or does it also bother you when your eyes are closed?

Yes, I haven't actually tried that.

That's difficult. I can imagine. Yes. Are there certain times when the symptoms increase?

It starts as soon as I wake up. But it's not all day long. I'm not sure what causes it to increase.

Okay. When you're sitting quietly and still in your chair, how is it then?

Then it's not so bad.

Then it's not so bad. And when you stand up, or move your head,

Getting up isn't too bad either.

But I do notice that I don't move my head around too much. I think that's because it makes it worse.

Yes.

And do you have any other symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting?

No vomiting, no. But I can feel a little nauseous.

Yes, and pain in your head?

No.

No, not that. Do you have any problems with your hearing or hearing loss, ringing in your ears?

No.

And have you had any problems with speech, difficulty speaking, getting your words out?

No. That's all still fine.


That's all still fine. Have you noticed any loss of function in your body?



Failure. What do you mean by that?


That your arms or legs are not functioning properly?

Well, when I feel dizzy like that, I have to grab hold of something and sit down for a moment.

But it's not that they're not functioning.

No, that's not it.

Any other complaints, such as heart palpitations?

I really don't feel well at those moments. My heart can also beat very fast. But then it goes away on its own.

And the vertigo you have. I call it vertigo because you have the tendency to feel like the room around you is spinning. I've forgotten what I was going to ask next. Oh yes. That was it. Do you ever feel like you're going to faint? Or have you ever fainted?

No, not that. I do feel a bit light-headed sometimes, but I've never fainted.

No, have you been ill recently, feeling unwell?

A bit of a cold. Yes.

Have you been confined to bed for a long period of time?

No. Not that.

No. Not that. No. Do you smoke?

No.

Do you drink alcohol?

No.

Do you use drugs?

No.

None of that. No. I've asked you quite a lot of questions. Are there any other issues you feel are important to discuss?

Well, a friend of mine has a brain tumour. And he also started having symptoms of dizziness. So I'm just really scared that that might be the case.

Yes, I understand that very well.

Because I just don't feel good about it and I don't know what to do about it.


Yes, well, what I want to do. I hear that you have that concern. What I want to do is examine you thoroughly. So I want to examine you from head to toe and then you can come with me to the treatment table.

Yes

Yes. All right. Well, the first thing I'm going to do is run some checks on you. So I'll measure your blood pressure and heart rate. Yes. And I'd also like to do a more extensive examination. But we'll get to all that in a moment.

Yes.

Your blood pressure is perfectly fine. Please remain very still with the cuff on. Well, your blood pressure is 110 over 70. That's excellent.

Look.

And a steady pulse of 62 per minute.

Perfectly healthy.

Those checks are indeed all fine. I would also like to give you a neurological examination from head to toe. So I'm going to give you a few tasks to do.

Yes. 

When I feel your face like this, does it feel the same on the left and right?

Yes. It feels the same.

Okay. Very good. Can you close your eyes tightly?

Yes.

you can open your eyes and raise your eyebrows. Now, clench your teeth. Puff out your cheeks. Very good. Can you stick out your tongue? Perfect. As far as possible. Yes. Yes. Good. Well, that's all going well, isn't it? Well, very good. Shall we tense our muscles? Can you bring your shoulders up towards your ears? Perfect. Can you flex your muscles? Yes, perfect. And. Look. Can you hold your arms. Can you hold them in front of you as if you were holding a tray. And then you can close your eyes. Keep your hands like that. Yes. No cheating. Very good, and then bring your right index finger to the tip of your nose. Very good. And the other side. Perfect. Well, you're doing very well. You may open your eyes again.


I'm feeling a bit dizzy now.

Feeling a bit dizzy now. Yes, yes, yes. Well. There are a few more tests. Let's go through them.

Yes.


Then we move on to the legs. You are now sitting on the edge of the treatment table. And then you can lift your right knee. Very good. Then we do the same on the left side. Yes, pull your right heel towards your buttock. So backwards. And then stretch your leg out again. And we'll do the same on the other side. Very good. So we pull it backwards and then stretch it out again. Wonderful. Let's see. Could you stand up and take a few steps? First, just walk up and down. You're doing very well. Can you walk step by step? So, one step at a time. And make sure your heels are right next to your toes. Well, that's going very well too.

Yes.

Yes, you're doing very well. Now I'm going to do some more specific tests for dizziness. First, just follow my finger with your eyes open. He's doing very well. I don't see any nystagmus.

What is that?

Nystagmus is a certain movement of the eye that you don't have much control over, and for me it's more of an indication to see if there's something wrong. Yes, and what I need to do about it. Or the absence of it.

I don't have that.

No. I don't see that now.

Okay, thank goodness.


So this is a very normal follow-through movement indeed. Yes. Then I will feel your head. I will move your head. You can try to relax it as much as possible and at some point I will move it back to the centre. Actually, at an unguarded moment. Well. That looks just fine too.

Okay.

So the HIT test is negative on both sides. That's great. Then I'd like to tip you over. So what I'm going to do is move the bench a little bit. So that I have a little more space. And then I want to move you, which basically means I want to move you from a sitting position to a lying position. With your head at a certain angle.

All right.

And it may be that I will provoke the symptoms, so that they will get worse. The most important thing for this, because it provides a lot of information, is that you keep your eyes open. So you can sit here on the edge. And then you can look at me. Turn your head a little and lift your chin a little. Then I will move you backwards in one movement. Like this. You are lying with your head over the edge.

Now it will get worse. Oh dear. I'm feeling a little nauseous too.

I can also see movement in your eye. You may not feel it, but I can see it.

Is that good or is that not good?

I'll explain that to you in a moment.

Oh. Okay.

Now get back up.

Yes.

It's quite intense when it's provoked like that.

Yes. It's quite intense right now.

Well, let's wait a moment until it subsides a little. And then we'll do it on the other side too.

Yes. Okay.

Good. I'll stand on the other side. That's fine. You can look back at me now. Lift your chin a little and we'll go back again.

Okay.

How is it on this side?

A little less. Not as intense as just now.

No. Well, you can slowly get up again.

All right. 

You may also. Please take a moment to relax and then you may sit back down on the chair. Yes. So I have just done some tests on you. In any case, I have not noticed any failure of the entire body. You had already indicated that yourself. So that is indeed very good in one case.


Yes. 

What I did notice is that when provoking these symptoms, or at least when moving from a sitting position to a lying position, I actually provoke the symptoms.

Then it becomes quite intense.

Indeed. Quite intense indeed. And it's actually good that we saw that, because it could also be related to a specific cause of the dizziness. As far as I'm concerned, I can forget the name again. But we call it benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV.

Okay.

And that's actually caused by something in the vestibular system.

Yes.


You mentioned earlier that you were afraid it might be related to a brain tumour, because a family member or friend of yours had one.

A friend, yes.

That it was present. But I'm not afraid of that at all.

Okay.

This is not something that comes from the head. But this is really something that is in the vestibular system.

Yes.

We actually have crystals in there. And sometimes, for some reason, those crystals can shift. And that's what's happening in your case. So you notice that the vertigo increases when you move your head or when you start moving at all.

Okay.

That's what triggers it in your case.

Yes, and that is not consistent with a tumour.

That is absolutely not consistent with a tumour.

Okay.

No, this is really outside the head, so to speak.

Yes, okay, good. 

So I think that's reassuring.

Yes.

The second thing is that this is also something that can go away on its own.

Okay.

That often takes a bit longer. But sometimes we can help. By performing a certain manoeuvre, which is basically that movement. We can help you perform that. I can do that. A physiotherapist can do that. We call it an Epley manoeuvre. But I can also give you instructions on how to perform it yourself.



Okay.

That will be done via thuisarts.nl. You send the information and then you can try it yourself at home. For this first time, we will do it here in the practice.

Okay.

And I will help you with that.

Yes, great. Yes, yes. I want to get rid of it. So I would really like that.

I understand that very well. Well, let's do that.

Shall we do that now?

Yes. We'll do it right away.

Thank you for taking the time. Yes.

Shall we end it there for now?

Yes. That's fine.

Yes, very good.

All right.

That's the end.

That was the end.
