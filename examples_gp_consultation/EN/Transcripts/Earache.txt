All right. Mrs P. Come in.

Thank you.

Hello. Have a seat. So, how was your holiday in Turkey?

It was good. Thank you.

Yes.

Very good.

Did you have a nice time?

Yes, definitely.

What did you do?
We were in Copa dotje, koppen dotje. We were in a hot air balloon, so to speak. It was fun.

Nice view? 


Yes, exactly.

Okay, nice. Hey. Of course, that's not why you're here today.

Yes.

Tell me, how can I help you?

Yes. My ear. My left ear doesn't feel so good. I feel a little, yes, I feel like my left ear is, let's say, filled with water.

It feels like there's water in it?

Yes, exactly. A little pain.

Okay, and does it feel like there's water in it? Or does it actually hurt?

Both.

Both, okay.

Yes, so, but between showers, a little more pain than. For example. No.

So when you've showered, it hurts more?

Yes, exactly. 

Okay. And how long have you had that?

Two, three days ago.

Okay.

A few days.

For a few days.

For a few days.


And did it happen suddenly or has it gradually gotten worse?

Gradually gotten worse.

It's slowly getting worse.

Yes, exactly.

And what do you hope I can do for you?

Yes. I don't know. I want to. I couldn't hear very well. So. It's not just pain. But also. How do you say it. Annoying for my hearing. So I can't. Hear very well. With my left ear. So yes. I, could you maybe look. What's happening in my.

Are you worried about your ear too?

What do you mean?

Are you scared?

Yes. A little, yes.

A little. And what are you scared of?

Yes. I don't know. It's not as good as my right ear.

Yes, okay.

That's why.

Do you mainly want the pain to go away?

What do you mean?

Do you want the pain to stop?

Yes, exactly. 

Okay, good. And are you ill?

No. No. Yes, I feel fine, actually. No fever. You could say that.

No fever.

No fever.

Yes, my body feels normal. So it's just my ear.

Just the left ear.

Yes, exactly.

That's what's bothering you.

Exactly.

So you're not ill. Have you taken your temperature?

No. Not yet.

But you don't feel feverish.

Yes, exactly.

But you haven't taken your temperature.

No.

No. Have you taken any painkillers?

What are painkillers?

Paracetamol or ibuprofen. Something like that?

No. No. Not like that. No. The pain is. How do you say it? Manageable.

The pain is bearable.

Yes, exactly.

And if you had to rate the pain. Between zero, no pain at all, and ten, very severe pain.

So. From. How do you say it? From zero to maybe four every day. But after showering, it feels like six or seven.

Yes. So just .All the time up to four, and then when showering, it's really a six or seven.

Three. Four. Yes, yes.

Okay. But really annoying, though.

Yes.

Okay, and are there things you can't do because you're in so much pain?

I can't exercise as much. I'm swimming a lot at the moment, every few days. So I can't swim very much.
Because then the pain gets worse.

Yes, exactly. And how long have you been swimming?

A few weeks.

A few weeks, oh, so it's a new sport?

A new sport. 

So before that, your ear didn't get wet very often?

Yes, exactly.

And do you still clean your ear with cotton buds?

What do you mean?

You do that with cotton wool in your ears. Do you do that with cotton buds too?

Yes.

How often?
Maybe a few times. Three. Three times a week.

Three times a week.

Not that often.

Not very often. Okay. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Otherwise, I'll take a look at your ears.

No, that's it.

That's it? Really? Yes. Okay. Well, let's take a look. And I understand that you've also become Dutch.

Yes.

When? Have you got your passport yet?

Sure.

Well, congratulations.

Thank you.

It must be strange to no longer be Indonesian. I imagine. Or not?

Yes, no, unfortunately. So I am.

Unfortunately.

Unfortunately.

All right. First, I'm going to take your temperature. No fever, thirty-six point two. Then I'll start on the right side first.

Yes.

From your ear. Then I can compare properly.

Yes.

Just sit still. The right side looks completely clean. The eardrum is fine too. Now for the painful side, your left ear. Does it hurt when I pull your ear?

Yes. A little bit.

It hurts a little. It's red and inflamed. I can see that the ear canal is a little swollen, red and thick.

Oh, really?

I can't see the eardrum very well.

Okay.

Okay. Right. Well, I've seen enough. I think. Your left ear is indeed inflamed.

Okay.

And it's mainly your ear canal that's inflamed. And that's because, I think, it often gets wet.

Okay. 

And maybe also a little bit because you clean it with a cotton bud. So I think we need to do a few things.

Okay.

You can take painkillers.

Okay.

That's paracetamol.

Okay.

You can take up to four thousand milligrams a day if necessary.

Okay. 

I'm going to give you some drops for your ears.

Okay.

Then you can use an anti-inflammatory, a slightly acidic drop that also reduces inflammation.

In my ear.

Yes. Then you have to do it three times a day. You have to put in the drops. 

Okay.

Yes, for one week.

For one week. Okay.

Yes. That's actually the most important thing. And no more cleaning with cotton wool.

Okay. 

And you also have to keep your ear dry for the next week.

Okay.
And then I want to see you again in a week. You'll need to come back for a consultation.

Perfect.

Do you have any questions?

No. That's all.

Okay. Well, that's great.

Thank you, Doctor.
