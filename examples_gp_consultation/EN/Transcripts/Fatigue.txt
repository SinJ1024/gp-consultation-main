Good afternoon.

Hello.

What can I do for you?

Yes. I've been feeling so incredibly tired lately.

Oh.

Yes, I'm just tired all day and I sleep a lot. But I just wake up tired.

Okay, and how long has it been?

Yes. Maybe two months of feeling like this.

Hey,

Yes

Yes. And was there anything leading up to this? Were you sick? Can you think of anything that caused this?

No. Because I think I sleep well. Maybe a bit more superficially sometimes. But nothing has necessarily happened in my life that makes me say, "Oh dear." That I'm spending more energy on.

And is there, is there a bit of a glitch in your story, or is it gradual?

That's hard to say. I don't know if I felt a lot more tired all at once or if it developed gradually.

Okay. Okay. And can you still do your work? What, what, how bad is the fatigue?

Well. I didn't call in sick at work. But I did think a few times: Should I call in sick tonight? But I didn't. And at the end of the day, I'm just really tired and I don't do anything anymore.

No.

And on the weekends, I'm just resting.

Catching up on sleep.

Yes, or maybe just hanging out more.

Okay.

Yes.

And exercising. I don't know. If you were already doing that before then. Is that still possible?

Yes. Exercising is possible.

Yes. Yes. What do you do?

I climb.

Okay.

Yes. Yes. So you do need strength for that, I guess. So that. Yeah, I don't notice much difference. Well. You know, sometimes you don't feel completely at ease when you're really tired. I get that quite often. But you're not lacking muscle power. Just saying...

No. It's not that I suddenly can't climb all the routes I used to climb.

Yes, and how often do you do that a week?

Two or three times a week.

Yes, yes. And other physical activities. Cycling, or...

Well, cycling is everything, anyway. And not electric. I think anyone who rides an electric bike is a wimp. Yes, God gave you two healthy legs for cycling. So yes.

And that works?

Yes, yes.

It's not that you're getting acid reflux or that you're out of breath. You don't have that at all?

No. I think I need a new bottom bracket.

Well. I would. Indeed.

Yes. Maybe that makes a bit of a difference.

No. But okay. You're saying it. Because I'm trying to figure out if it's a heart and lung issue or something like that. But if I hear you right... Conditioning. Physical condition hasn't deteriorated dramatically, at least.

No. No. Not that. I do feel like I have a bit more muscle pain.

Okay

Yes. Back pain too. Yes, more than usual. Yes.

Okay. So now. Let me summarize. Tired for two months.

Yes.

Possibly superficial sleep. There's no real clear cause. Not a very clear acute onset. And you can still do your sports. Work is going along with all your might, not very enthusiastically. But you haven't called in sick yet. And I can imagine you're saying: like, hey. What's going on here?

Yes, I'm a bit unsure. Is there something wrong with my body? Also with the muscle pain or something? I did some Googling and chatted with chatGPT. And then I was still thinking a bit. Maybe I have some rheumatism or something.

Okay

Because I do too. Yes. It said morning stiffness. I actually do have that quite a bit.

Yes.

Yes, yes.

Yes.

Can you see that in the blood?

Which, I actually think is important. Yes, there are things you can check in the blood for these symptoms. But I'm also curious. You know, does it run in your family, that you know of?

No. Yes, my father always had back problems too.

Okay.

Not specifically with weights. Just saying. And specifically. Joints in the hand or foot, with the small weights.

No
No, Okay. And you yourself have also had pain specifically in your joints these past few months.

No, no

Not noticed anyway.

No.

No, Okay. Then it's not the first thing I immediately think of. Let's put it that way. Anyway. I do have a few quick questions for you, just to get a feel for it. For me to get a feel for it. One way or another. I'm going to go over everything. Because, well. You say: Shallow sleep is possible. Do you know if you snore?

No, no. I don't snore. No, no.

You do have someone who might hear that.

No. I often wake up with a start and do something strange. My wife says that sometimes.

Okay.

But I don't snore.

No, and is that startling every night or something?

No. Maybe once a week. But I've been doing that my whole life.

Okay. Okay. That's not new. No.

No.

Okay, and no other respiratory problems. No allergies or anything at the moment. That's a factor.

Well. You can probably tell. I recently asked for hay fever pills and for those eye drops. But that actually works really well.

So that's actually under control this way.

Yes.

Yes. And heart-wise. We've already touched on that a bit. But otherwise, no unusual palpitations. No chest pain.

No.

Story.

No, no. No

And eating is normal? Good appetite?

Yes

Weight stable, right? As far as you know.
Yes, yes. I step on the scale every now and then. But it's always seventy two kilos. Yes.

Stools. Have you noticed anything, or is it just what you're used to?

Kind of like what I'm used to.

And that's daily?

Daily, yes, several times a day.

Okay.

Smooth.

Smooth. Yes, yes. Coffee is doing its job.

Yes, yes, yes. But more than three times a day.

Sometimes four times a day.

Okay. But not much more than that.

No, okay. And peeing is normal?

Peeing is also going fine.

Yeah, okay. Have you noticed any other things? When we're talking like this, you think, hey: That's also useful to mention.

No

No, okay, no. About that. I don't really have a clue where this is coming from. If I'm like, huh? A lot of things are going well.

So there's nothing scary?

Well, I wouldn't dare rule that out yet. I just want to do a little physical examination.

Yeah

Then I'm definitely going to check your heart and lungs. Just listen. Just to be sure. I'm going to look at your back. Because that's bothering you now, isn't it?

Yeah

Yeah, okay. Well then I'm going to take your blood pressure. Well. It's a hundred and ten over sixty, wow.

Is that good?

That's great.

That's a nice, healthy blood pressure. At least not too high.

Okay. That's good.


Okay. That's good.

And... Your heart rate is sixty or lower. Sixty, fifty.

Is that normal, doctor?

Forty. Well, I see that in people who are athletic.

Oh, yes.

I think it's a good sign, actually.

Yes, okay.

Lungs sound perfectly fine. Well, I'm going to take a quick look at your back first. First, all your vertebrae. Does it hurt anywhere specific when I press here? No. Yes. A bit down there. Next to the center.

Okay.

And when I press on your pelvis from the side like this, does that hurt?

No. What are you testing with that?

If your bone is somehow going on with your bones. Well, I didn't expect that either. And when I massage your long back muscles like that, is that?

That feels good.

Well, I see, I see. If I see something strange, I see a difference between left and right.

No.

No, and your neck muscles too. You can just move your neck back and forth. That doesn't hurt any more.

That's fine.

Shoulders free. Okay. I'm going to take another look at your abdomen. I hear lively peristalsis. And if I look at your abdomen now...

What does that mean, doctor?

Yes, no, they are. They're nice and active. The intestines make the sounds I like to hear.

Yes, okay.

And if I knock now, I hear varying sounds. That's fine too. That's how it should be. And if I feel through your abdomen now, does it hurt here? Can I do all this? It feels supple?

A little uncomfortable. But it doesn't hurt.

No pain. No sharp pain. Okay. Good. Yes. Well, actually. If I look at you like this, I don't see any gross abnormalities. Still, I think it's strange that you're suddenly so tired. And I'm tempted to do some blood tests myself. I don't know how you feel about that.

Yes, well. I might like to see how things are going.

Yes. Yes. Again. I have absolutely no clue right now. I definitely want to check if you have anemia. I'm also going to check your thyroid. Because sometimes those are hidden things you don't otherwise discover, and they can also cause these kinds of symptoms. And I can also check for inflammation. I can try that myself now. I don't have any clear indications for that right now. Anyway. I'm going to check for inflammation in your blood. If those are completely perfect, then I think rheumatoid arthritis is completely unlikely. And I think we should check that first.

Great. Okay.

If you get it tested. I'll have the results the day after the test. And call me the day after, and then we can schedule a phone appointment to see if anything comes up and what happens next.

Yes. Okay. Then I'll call. Yes.

Okay. You'll get the form in your inbox. That you don't make an appointment yourself at Atal Medial.

Okay. Well. I'll do that. I'm pretty good with a computer.

Yes. I thought so.

Okay. Bye.

Bye.
