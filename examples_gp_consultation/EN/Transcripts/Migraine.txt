Hi. Good afternoon. Great to see you here. I saw you were coming because of headaches. Tell me: how long has this been going on, and can you tell me a bit about it?

Yes. It's been going on for a few months now. Let's say about two months.

Yes.

I have a headache. And I feel like it's getting worse.

Okay.

And now I thought: it might be a good idea to make an appointment with the doctor and just talk about it further.

Yes, yes. Hey, and you say: headache. Is it in one specific spot or is it in multiple places? Or, uh...

I find that very difficult to describe. But I feel like it's a bit, yes, more on the right side. But sometimes it just hurts everywhere. But especially on the right.

Okay, and are there any other symptoms? And then you might think: are you also nauseous or vomiting? Those two things.

When it's at its worst, I feel a bit nauseous. But I've never thrown up from it.

And things like flashes of light in your eye. Do you recognize that?

No flashes. But I do think I have a bit of a glare.

Okay.

In my vision, yes.

Do you have it? Because you say: It's been a few months now, or two months. Do you take something then? Do you take something for the pain?

I was on vacation in Aruba at the time, and they don't have very much there. And I thought I'd just try some paracetamol. I was on the beach there, with the blanket, when it suddenly started acting up.

Yes, yes.

We actually wanted to play volleyball at that moment.
Yes, yes.

A few friends were there too, and they all went drinking beer, so I couldn't really join them anymore. Because I had a headache.

It was nice in Aruba, by the way. So, have you been kitesurfing yet?

Yes. It was really wonderful.

We had a minimum of thirty degrees. The water was nice and warm too. I didn't kitesurf. But we did scuba dive.

Oh yeah, that's really good there too.

That's really fun too. Definitely. And don't stand in sea urchins and stuff like that.

No, no, no.

A friend of mine had that once. That's really awful.

That's really painful. I can imagine. Yes, yes.

Hey. Back to your headaches. So you say: it's been going on for a few months. And from way back. Like, because you're twenty now. Don't you recognize that? Like, like, from childhood. Does headaches still run in the family?

I did make some inquiries. Here and there. There are some relatives. For example, my father has migraines. And I think my grandfather had cluster headaches.

Oh yeah.

So there are some headaches in the family.

Yes, yes, yes.

But never anything serious.

No.

For example, tumors or something.

No. Not that kind of thing.

No.
And. Was it a few months ago? Or have you been experiencing more stress for a few months now? Or are you still thinking, God. That's made it all worse, or is there something else that could explain the symptoms?

Well, I would think so. Because the past few months were vacations. There wasn't a lot of stress going on, and not necessarily a lot of stress before that either.

No.

A few things I haven't done anymore. Definitely no coffee. I've never had energy drinks. So those are more or less the things I've done. I just tried. I'd read online that you shouldn't take too much paracetamol.

No, that's right. Yes.

So only if it was absolutely unbearable. I did that.

Yes.

I also tried ibuprofen once, and that worked well.

Okay.

Yes.

Yes.

Yet, I noticed the headache was still there, and especially that glare of light that stood out.

And then you have a headache. Because, is it once a week, and how long does it last? Or does it happen often during the week?

Well. Now I've had it twice. Well, wait. I have to rephrase it. So, in the beginning, I had it once. Then it didn't happen for a few weeks, and then it came almost every week, at least once.

Oh yeah.

So that's the worsening.

Yes.
And something else I notice. It comes then, it simmers. It lasts for a few days or so, and then it subsides. And I'd actually prefer to be in a dark hole.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

When people talk to me, it only gets worse.

Yes.

Yes.

And do you drink alcohol?

Yes, very occasionally. When I was on vacation, I drank a beer. But never more than two or three, actually.

Per.

Per time we have a beer. No. Not per hour. Per time we drink something. So per day, so to speak.

Do you smoke?

No.

Do you use drugs?

No.

Hey, so you're saying: If I can summarize. I've been experiencing these headache complaints for about two months now. So they're increasing. There are some complaints in the family. In someone with cluster headaches. Someone with migraines.

Yes.

These are new complaints for you. If I understand correctly. It's not like you're thinking, "Oh, that's what's causing it," and feeling a bit nauseous. Not really vomiting, and you can have that sparkle in your eyes, and you'd prefer to lie down in a dark room.

Yes.

And is your question: "Gosh, what's the best thing to do?" Would you like more information about it?

I'd actually just like to...

Are you worried?

What is it? Could this be a migraine, for example? Or is this more like a cluster headache? And especially, what's the best thing to do about it?

Yes, and what kind of work do you do?

I'm a student.

Okay.

And what are you studying? I'm studying medicine.

Okay. Cool.

Yes.

Cool or not?

Yes. Definitely.

Okay.

What year are you in?

Yes. So I'm twenty years old. What does a twenty-year-old do? They're usually in their second year.

Oh yeah, exactly. Second. What I'd like to suggest: First, let's take your blood pressure. We'll do a quick neurological examination, and then we'll just make a plan, right?

Great, yeah.

Okay. Well, let's take your blood pressure. It's a hundred and twenty over eighty. You have a steady pulse. Fifty per minute. Do you exercise a lot, by the way?

Yes.

Exactly. And what do you do then?

Yes. I work out four times a week and run occasionally and cycle occasionally.
Those are the things I do.

So, pretty sporty.

If we do further neurological examination. Cranial nerves are fine. Fingertip-nose test is good. Arm and leg strength is good. Romberg's is normal. Try walking a straight line for a bit. It's a bit manageable. It's a bit off. But okay. That was it. Can you sit down again? Okay. Yes. When I hear that. What you're saying, I think so indeed. It could very well be a migraine. Sometimes, I don't know if you've read anything about it yet?

A little bit. Yes.

So the headache fits in with it. The glare could also fit in with it. Also what you said about, well, preferably lying down in a dark room. And sometimes there are factors that can make it worse. That's all nicely described on thuisarts.nl. You could read that again.

Oh yeah.

I'll show you in a moment. And what's important with migraine is... I actually don't think it fits in with cluster headaches. And what's important with migraine is that from now on... What you could try is as soon as you start experiencing symptoms from sun glare. Because I don't really know. Does the glare start with that, or does it start with the headache when you have those symptoms?

That's a good question. I think I have a bit of a headache at first, and then the flare-up comes.

Okay. So, actually. What's important with migraines is that as soon as the symptoms start, you immediately take some pain relief. You could start with paracetamol. You can take it four times two, and you can do it at fixed times. If that doesn't work enough, you can add ibuprofen.

Oh yeah.

And what we could do in the coming period is that we just keep a record of, well, for the next few weeks. Anyway. First, you can read about migraines on thuisarts.nl. Do I recognize anything in it? That's one thing. The second is: Start taking pain relief as soon as you start experiencing symptoms. And... Thuisarts.nl also has a very nice... Is it still working? There's also a very nice diary you can keep. I can print it out for you right now. A headache diary, and maybe we can take a look at it sometime. Are there factors that make it worse? Or can I recognize patterns, say, in the coming weeks? Like, if you're very stressed, does it get worse? Or if you've had coffee, does it get worse? And so on. And so on. That you keep a record of that for a while, and then we'll, say, in a month. That you come back then, and then you bring the diary back, and then we'll evaluate briefly. How things are going and whether we can identify any factors that are making it worse.

Yes. Okay. So I'm going to read the information. And if I have a headache, I'll start with painkillers. Paracetamol and ibuprofen. If necessary.
Yes.

And I'm going to keep a diary.

Yes, exactly.

And then see what makes it worse. What makes it less bad?

Exactly. That would be my suggestion.

And then come back after that.

Yes. So we could also schedule an appointment in four weeks. If you're saying, "Gosh. I have a question. Things are much worse. Or things are changing. I'd obviously like you to come back sooner."

Yes, absolutely fine.

Is that an idea?

Yes, of course. Sounds great. Let's do that.

Okay? Then I'll print it out for you. I'll show it on thuisarts.nl. And then I'll print it out for you, that headache diary.

Great. Thank you.

Okay, have a nice afternoon.

Thank you.
