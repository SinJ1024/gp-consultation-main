How are you. Welcome.

Yes. Thank you.

I saw in the calendar that you had made an appointment. You were having back problems.

Yes, that's right. My back is really bothering me. I've had it for about a week and a half now, and it's only getting worse. I also notice that it radiates down my leg.

Okay.

It's actually a bit on the right side.

You're pointing to the right.

It really goes through my leg, thigh, and radiates all the way down to my foot. 

And you pointed a little to the back of your thigh. Is that right?

That's right. Yes, it goes through the back and then through my lower leg, more on the side.

Okay.

All the way to my foot, actually.

Gosh, a week and a half of discomfort.

Yes.

That's awful to hear.

Yes, yes. It's very uncomfortable. I can't sleep because of it. Nothing helps.

Okay. 

So I am concerned about that too. But I really want to get rid of it.

I understand that you have made an appointment.

That you are losing sleep over it. That is really very unpleasant. I hear that you want to get rid of it.
I'm going to ask you a few more questions first, then I'll do a physical examination and then we can definitely talk about it.

That's fine.

If I may summarise briefly. So, a week and a half of discomfort, pain in your back that radiates down your right leg via the back and side to your foot.

Yes. That's right.

Are you taking anything for the pain?

Yes. I've taken paracetamol and ibuprofen. And I've actually taken the maximum doses. But it doesn't really help.

Are there times when you experience more discomfort than at other times?

No. I actually have discomfort all day long. I've tried to pay attention to it. But no. It just hurts a lot.

Okay. And I understand that you have trouble sleeping as well.

I have trouble sleeping. Yes, I just can't get comfortable and then I have to get up again. And I've actually been lying awake for nights. This really can't go on any longer.

Oh No. And what kind of daily activities do you do?

I work. In the supermarket, and I have to. So it started when I had to lift heavy things occasionally.

It's almost impossible, I think, isn't it? How do you manage that?

Well, I've temporarily stopped working because I just can't do it. Yes, so that's what I'm doing, and exercising. But that's not really working either.

No, I understand. And a few more questions. Because you're talking about pain now. Do you feel like you still have strength in your leg or has it decreased?

No. I can still do it. I still have the strength. Yes. It's more that the pain sometimes stops me. Because the pain makes it difficult for me to move.

But I understand that.

The strength is there.

And when you touch your leg or your foot, is it the same as on the left side?

I feel like it's a little duller. On the outside of my lower leg. It feels a little different there.

And do you experience tingling?


Yes, a little.

And where is that tingling?

Yes. Yes. It's difficult to say exactly where. I think it's a bit in the same place where it hurts.

Another important question is: do you feel okay in the area around your bottom and lower back? We call that the riding breeches area, it's the part you sit on. When you sit on it, do you feel normal or when you wipe there?

Yes, that's normal.

Normally can you feel it well when you need to poo. Or when you need to pee.

Yes. I have no problem with that.

That's fine. I actually already have a pretty clear picture of what you're telling me. So I would really like to do some physical examination now and then I'll look at your back and your legs. If you would like to take off your trousers. Then you can go to the examination bench. 

All right, and my shoes too?

Yes, please. Socks too.

Okay. Yes, yes. That's fine.

Okay. Well, I did notice that you were in some pain when you got on the couch. Wasn't that so?

Yes. That did hurt, yes.

I can see that. I can see that it hurts. I'm going to look at your legs now and I don't see anything unusual. So your left leg and your right leg look the same, and I didn't see anything unusual near your back either. I felt your back for a moment. But it feels normal. It's not like when I press on your vertebrae and it hurts a lot. I think. Let's try. 

Yes. No. That doesn't hurt. No, no. It hurts so much here.


Yes. More towards your bum and behind it. Yes. Okay. Then I'm going to lift your right leg all the way up. Like this. How does that feel?

That hurts.

Calm down. Slowly down. Very good. Okay. Now we're going to lift your other leg. Just like that, straight up. That's fine. It looks fine. Right? I don't think that hurts so much.


No. No. It's really the right side.

And if I touch you like this. Here on your leg. Here on your foot, left and right. Do you feel a difference?

Ooh. Would you like me to do that again?

Yes.

I do feel that it feels a bit different.

Okay.

So you do feel a bit of a difference between left and right?

Yes.

Is that a dull feeling?

Yes. It feels a bit dull on the right side.

Okay. Very good. Good that you mention that. Now we're going to test your strength. So I want to ask you to sit on the edge of the bench again. Can you do that? And then I'm going to test your left and right legs one by one, and you can push against my hand as hard as you can. So first here, yes.

All right.

All right.

Put that force on the other side. I understand that it hurts. But good. The fact that you're doing it gives me a lot of information. Shall I try the other side?

Yes. Yes. 

It's just as strong, in any case. Then I'll do your lower legs at the same time: push forward again: all right.

Like that.

Yes. Very good.

And pull towards it from behind. Yes. Good. Now you can move your toes upwards. I'm going to push. Okay, and now you can pretend you're accelerating. Okay, well done. The strength is definitely there, but I can see that it hurts. The last test I'm going to do is with a reflex hammer. So I'll tap the first two. Yes. That side. Near your heel. The other side. Then I'm going to tickle under your foot with a stick. So that might feel a little strange. On the other side. Okay. Your reflexes are all good. So okay. You can sit down on the chair. Then I'll explain a few things to you. Well, based on what you've told him and the physical examination, I really think it's a hernia.

Okay.

Have you ever heard of it?

It's in your back, something to do with an intervertebral disc or something.

Very good. Do you know anything about it?

Well, I have a neighbour who has it. I think. She had it once and it bothered her for a long time and she had to have surgery.

Oh yes.

That's all I know, really.

I'll tell you a bit about that too.

Please do.

So what you're saying is correct. Your vertebrae are all bones, and between them is a disc. We call that an intervertebral disc. It's made of a softer material and can sometimes radiate pain. To the left or to the right. And it may be that it compresses a nerve, and I think that's what's happening with you, and by compressing that nerve, it causes pain along the entire length of the nerve. So that's the pain you're feeling. It's really nerve pain. And if it's compressed for too long, it can also cause you to feel less sensation or feel tingling. Well, less sensation. That's what you're describing. Some people may also experience differences in their reflexes. That's why I tapped it with the hammer and found that the strength is reduced. Fortunately, that's not the case with you yet. We know that this is very painful. So I'm not at all surprised that it hurts so much. I feel very sorry for you. Because I hear that it's also keeping you awake at night.

Yes, that's right.

The tricky thing is that we don't have a very direct treatment to take away your pain. So it's going to take quite a while before we get you back on track. The treatment actually consists of two parts, one of which is pain relief. You said you've been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen. We know that nerve pain doesn't respond as well to these. So I'd like to start you on a different painkiller: pregabalin.

Okay. 

That's a medicine that does have side effects. That's why we always build up the dose slowly, so that you don't suffer too much from the side effects.

Yes.

It's good to know that you can't always drive after you start taking it. I don't know if that will be a problem for you in the coming weeks?

Well, I can't work right now anyway. How long will I not be allowed to drive?

At least when you start or build up the dosage. You won't be allowed to drive for a week after that. Or if you experience side effects.

Okay. And will it help me sleep again? Because I really can't take it anymore.

Yes, I understand.

That is, of course, one of the goals of the pain relief. So that you can sleep better. That is what we hope this will do. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right dosage. One that keeps you pain-free. So we will have to work on that together in the coming period. It is possible that we will see each other again or have another telephone conversation.

And do I still need to see a specialist for a CT scan or an MRI? Or what do they do these days?

All right. So you're saying that one part is pain relief. The other part is to see if we can make sure that nerve is less constricted. We can do that by doing exercises and making your back more flexible again. In the hope that the intervertebral disc will shrink a little and go back into place. And the physiotherapist can help guide you in doing the exercises.

Okay.

And that way, it can just go away on its own. You just said that your neighbour also had surgery once.

Yes.

That is indeed sometimes done if the hernia persists for a very long time and does not go away on its own with the physiotherapist's exercises.

Okay. How long does it take for the hernia to go away?

It can take a few weeks or even a few months.

Oh dear.

We know that people we operate on have fewer complaints at the beginning of the post-operative period. In the longer term, however, the complaints actually return to the same level. That is why we are not so inclined to refer people immediately. Because if we operate on you, you will need to undergo rehabilitation. Then there is the possibility of complications during the operation. So, if possible, we prefer to postpone it. This means that we first try pain relief and physiotherapy. If that does not work, we can always consider referring you for surgery, which may involve a scan.

Okay. But that is not necessary now?

Not now.

No. Okay.

It is important that you contact me again if your symptoms worsen. For example, if you don't have a good feeling in the riding breeches area we talked about, the area around your behind. If you can't feel when you need to urinate or defecate and if you really can't move your leg anymore because there is no strength in it.

Okay.

That's a reason to contact me or the GP out-of-hours service sooner.

Then I'd like to schedule a telephone appointment with you in a week's time to discuss how the pain relief is going.

Yes. That's fine. So I'm getting a pill now. I have to go to the apothecary to pick it up. I'm not allowed to drive and I don't need a scan or surgery for now. And physiotherapy, perhaps?

Yes. I would recommend that.

All right. We'll call you next week, then.

Well, that's good. Oh, what a mess.

Can you work with that?

Yes. Thank you very much, Doctor.

All right, bye.
