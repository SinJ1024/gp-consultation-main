Hello. Welcome. Come on in.

Hi, Good morning.

Gosh, completely soaked.

Yeah, oh well. Yeah, sorry I'm a bit late too. But really. So much headwind and yes, you can see I'm completely soaked.

Really Dutch weather at its best, right?

Yeah, terrible.

Yeah, well. You're dry here.

Thankfully. And nice and warm. Nice and warm here too.

That too. Well, sit down.

My glasses are fogging up.

I see. Well, what can I do for you today?

So, I've had a sore throat for three days now, and I also had a bit of a fever this morning, and I thought: yeah, I'll call just to be sure.

Yeah. Very good. Hey, so you've had a sore throat with a fever for three days now. You say. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

Yeah, yeah. It also started with a bit of a cough. Last week I wasn't feeling completely well, and now this sore throat. I've also taken paracetamol and ibuprofen. But this sore throat is just unbearable. Everything hurts when I swallow.

Yeah, it's annoying, man. Painful when I swallow. I hear.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, and do you have any other symptoms besides that? So, a sore throat. And you mentioned a fever.

Yeah, no. Yeah, the coughing's gone too. So, no.

So, it's mainly just the sore throat now.

Yeah.

Okay. Okay. Hey, and do you have any other symptoms, like are you short of breath?

No.

No, okay. And are you able to swallow? To drink, for example?

Yeah. I can. But it really hurts.

Yeah, yeah. Very painful. Okay. And do you notice that you also have a cold, like a runny nose?

No, no. Not really.

No. Not coughing?

Yes. So I did last week.

Oh yeah. Last week you said, okay. Okay. And have anyone around you been sick?

No, no. But yeah. A friend of mine had it too, and she had a complete abscess, and yes, I actually think I might need antibiotics.

Oh yeah. Okay. So that's where your concern lies? Actually, do I maybe have an abscess?

Yes.

Yes. Well, yeah. That seems justified, and we'll definitely look into it. Let me think about it. Because have you had these symptoms this bad before?

I've had a sore throat before. But that was a few years ago.

Okay. Okay. And did it go away on its own then? Or did you take antibiotics for it?

I did take antibiotics for it once as a child.

Yeah, okay. I think we should just take a look. Can you sit down on the examining table for a moment?

Okay. Let's do that.

You're wearing a really nice coat, by the way.

Thank you. Yes. It's new, from Stiglitz.

Oh. Great, I'll save it. Hey, take a seat. I want to go first. I'm just going to check everything. So, hey... I want to take a quick look in your ears. In your throat. So, I'll start with your ears for a moment. Let me take a quick look first. I'll take a quick look at the left side. Well, I see an air-filled eardrum. No other signs of inflammation. Right ear, a little redness in the ear canal. But otherwise, it looks normal. No signs of inflammation. Let me feel your neck. Your neck. Check for lymphadenopathy. I'm feeling some small lymph nodes, submandibular, not pathological. I'll also take your temperature. Beep-beep. Thirty-eight-three. Oh yeah. You do have a slight fever, and did you take any paracetamol or anything else for this?

Yes. I took two paracetamols this morning.

Okay. But that's it, it's three o'clock now. So that's worn off by now. You really have a slight fever

I'd like to take a look in your throat. I'll come with the spatula. I see a median uvula. I see a slightly red pharyngeal arch. You do have slightly enlarged tonsils. They're not kissing. I see a little slough on both sides. I don't suspect an abscess. Okay. Clear. Yes, you can close your mouth again. Just to be sure, I'll listen to your lungs again. Auscultation of the lungs, you can breathe in thoroughly. Yes, in and out. Through your mouth. Very good. I hear: vesicular breath sounds. No additional sounds. Sounds good. Let me check your saturation. Ninety-eight percent. That's good too. Okay. Absolutely fine. Yes. Can you come back and sit down? Okay. Well, I've checked everything carefully. Well, I do see that you have a fever. So I understand that you're not feeling well. Fortunately, I don't see any signs that really worry me at the moment. So, hey, you mentioned an abscess. I absolutely don't see that. So I'm really not worried about that. I do see that your throat is a bit red and that your tonsils are a bit enlarged. That definitely indicates an infection. So I do think you have a sore throat. But based on these symptoms, I can actually say that it's most likely a virus that you have. And that, unfortunately. But fortunately, it's also really just a matter of waiting it out.

So I don't need antibiotics.

No, no. Yes, antibiotics aren't going to help you any further now either.

Oh, too bad. I thought I'd get rid of my symptoms faster with antibiotics.

I understand. Yes, no. Unfortunately, that's not the case. With this kind of sore throat, antibiotics are used. You might get rid of your symptoms half a day sooner. But otherwise, they won't really affect the course of the illness.

And what should I do about the pain?

Yes. Good question. It's especially important to keep taking paracetamol, and if that doesn't help enough, you can also take ibuprofen. You can take paracetamol four times a day, and ibuprofen three times a day. Possibly a tablet of four hundred. And keep drinking plenty of fluids. Something that can help is cold. Cold drinks or popsicles, for example. That helps with the pain. And basically, it's a matter of waiting it out. If, despite this, you do get much sicker, or if you have shortness of breath, or if you can no longer swallow properly, etc., then that's a reason to contact us again. Is that clear enough?

Certainly. Then I'll just go back out into the rain, that rain.

Braving the rain. Well, let's go home. I'd say.

Yeah, okay.

Get well soon.

Hey, thanks. Keep working.

Bye.
