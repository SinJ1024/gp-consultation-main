Tell me. What can I do for you?

Good afternoon. I came by to have a spot on my neck looked at. I've had something there for about two weeks now. I thought it started as a wart, but it doesn't end like one. Scabs have fallen off every now and then. I've also been bitten by an insect there. So it's gotten a bit swollen and redder. But it's not a wart, and I was wondering if there's anything I can do about it.

Yes, so you're saying: I have a spot on my neck. I thought it was a wart. But now I don't think it's a wart.

Exactly.

And when did you first notice something?

I think it was after shaving, a small wound. That's how warts start. Warts have started in another spot on my skin, a small wound, and then a wart develops. Yes, so it started with a wound. But also an insect bite.

That's kind of how it started. But do you remember when you first saw it?

Yes, two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago. Are you worried about it?

I looked online. Of course, I took a picture. Very close up. Good quality. I used Google Lens and AI to look at what it could be. I did come across some frightening things.

What kind of things did you encounter?

A serious form of skin cancer, especially for the elderly. So, people over seventy. So I guess I'm safe from that. But...

You're not really over seventy, are you?

No. But if something like this looks like it... Then, yes, I do worry a bit.

Do you remember what that shape was called?

No. No. Such a strange Latin name.

No.

I can't figure it out.

Okay. So, a spot. It started two or three weeks ago. Maybe after shaving. And does it bother you?

It itches. Yes, but also that insect bite. Who knows?

Are you saying there might be a reaction to an insect bite?

That's possible. Yes.

Yes. And does it hurt?

No.

And have you had similar spots before?

Warts, then, but nothing else besides that.

Have you ever had spots removed?

An abscess in my ear once.

Okay. That's a completely different story. I think.

That also has to do with the skin, right?

No. Definitely. But that was opened or something. And then it was gone.
Yes

Okay. What memories do you have of that? You don't look very happy about it.

It was a tough job. Luckily, I didn't have to see it myself. It didn't look very good.

From the outside. For the people who had to do it.

For the practitioner.

Do you know if there are any skin malignancies in your family?

Not so much skin-related. Well, yes. Especially on my father's side. So my grandfather and uncles mainly have skin problems from the sun on their heads. Furthermore.

Do you happen to know what that was: actinic keratosis. Squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma. Melanoma?

Melanoma sounds appealing to me. But, I have no idea what it actually is.

You don't know what it's called. No. Okay.

I don't think it's malignant.

Okay. Then it wasn't melanoma. That's quite malignant.

Okay. Too bad.

Yes, okay. Okay, I'll go take a look at it. I'm going to grab my glasses first. And then I'll go. Come a little closer. First, feel the spot. It's a bit raised. I think about half a centimeter. A bit pinkish-red. There's a slightly redder spot in the middle. I'll grab a magnifying glass to take a look at it. I can measure it with that too.

Another pair of glasses.

And then put a little gel on your skin, you know. Because then I can see without refraction. Then I can measure it even better.

Is there also that kind of flaking on it now? It flakes every now and then. Or then a half-scab forms, and then it falls off again, and then a new one forms.

Okay. I can't see it now, to be honest. A scab.

Okay.

Did you scratch it to see if that might have caused a crust to form?

No. I haven't scratched it in the past few days.

And you don't have any similar spots elsewhere on your skin?

No
No, I'll also feel if you have lymph nodes in your neck. Other details. I'll just check your neck to see if you have any other spots there. I only see some freckles. It's a bit of a strange spot.

Could it have formed from a freckle?

Well. Freckles are usually light brown, and this one is actually pink. I've also never seen a freckle become so swollen. Well, to be honest. I wouldn't dare say right away what it is. So I suggest I take a picture of it and send it to a dermatologist. Is that okay with you?

Yes. Sounds good.

Yes. Then we'll need to get a good light. If you're looking that way.

I already have a good picture of it. If you need it.

Oh, okay. Well. You can text it to me if that's okay with you. I'll just add a picture with a centimeter. Yeah. I don't know. It could be a pyogenic granuloma. Something that started from a wound. It could also be some kind of atypical mole.

I don't dare label it that way right away. But I think the dermatologist will have an answer by the end of this week. So I'll send it via e-consultation, that's what we call it. That won't be deducted from your deductible, by the way. And then you call yourself on Friday to get their advice.

To the GP or to the dermatologist.

Yes, to us. And then the best option, I think, is: will you be easily reachable on Friday?

Yes, yes.

If you make sure your cell phone is on, I'll call you between twelve and half past one.

No. That's not really convenient. I'll be in class then. I think. Maybe before ten or after three. That's ideal.

I'll add it to my calendar. But if it doesn't work out, can I use your cell phone? Leave a voicemail?

Yes. That's fine too.

Okay. Because I suspect the advice is to have it removed. But how? I can't quite say. Maybe I can tell you something about the different methods. Would you like to know more about that?

Yes, okay.

Sometimes.

I want to get rid of it.

Sometimes we can freeze it. Then we dab it with liquid nitrogen.

And how effective is that?

Well. With a bulge like that, the cold doesn't always penetrate all the way to the bottom. So sometimes it needs to be dabbed again. Sometimes it's also advised to remove it completely by taking a small area of ​​skin with it. So then we numb it first and remove a spot. And sometimes we can also remove it with a kind of scraping device. And then it can also be sent for tissue analysis. So we can say for sure what it is.

That sounds good.

So. You're looking forward to it. Do you really have memories of that ear? That you're starting to look a little scared?

No. That wasn't too bad. The anesthetic really helps. But the spots on my neck are a bit different. They just don't feel comfortable at all. If something sharp gets near them. That freezing. That's still manageable. I think.

So if there are several options, you say: then go for the freezing, please.

Yes, please.

We'll wait for the dermatologist's answer. Did you have any other questions?
Yes. I don't know if I'm talking to the right person. But I've also been having some pain in my knee, actually. Since, that's been going on for a few months now. It's not very severe. But, every now and then after running, it lingers for a few days.

And that's been going on for a few months, you say.

Yes. I don't run very often either; playing soccer is fine too. But it's just a kind of strange pain that seems to develop after running the same way for a long time.

Okay.

Then it takes a long time. Before it goes away again. I think it's a good idea to take a look at it sometime. But unfortunately, there's no time for that during this consultation. So if that bothers you, I think it would be a good idea to make another appointment.

That's understandable. That's fine too.

Okay. Fine. Well. We'll see each other on Friday then.

Okay.

Yes. Okay, fine.

Well. Thank you. For this recording.

Thank you for the consultation.

And see you soon.

Bye, bye.
